speaker_heading: AN ORIGIN
text: This story takes place in its own universe. It has no
dialog: connection to any of the DC films that have come before it.
text: We see it as a classic Warner Bros. movie. Gritty, intimate
text: and oddly funny, the characters live in the real world and
dialog: the stakes are personal.
text: Although it is never mentioned in the film, this story takes
dialog: place in the past.
dialog: Let's call it 1981.
dialog: It's a troubled time. The crime rate in Gotham is at record
text: highs. A garbage strike has crippled the city for the past
dialog: six weeks. And the divide between the "haves" and the "have-
text: nots" is palpable. Dreams are beyond reach, slipping into
dialog: delusions.
speaker_heading: OVER BLACK:
text: HEAR LAUGHTER.
text: The sound of a man totally cracking up.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: 1 INT. DEPT. OF HEALTH, OFFICE - MORNING 1
text: CLOSE ON JOKER (30's), tears in his eyes from laughing so
text: hard. He's trying to get it under control. His greasy, black
text: hair is matted down. He's wearing an old, faded red hooded
text: zip-up sweatshirt, a threadbare gray scarf, thin from years
text: of use, hangs loosely around his neck.
text: WE NOTICE TWO FADED OLD SCARS cut at the corners of his
text: mouth. Almost forming a smile.
text: He's sitting across from an overworked SOCIAL WORKER (50's),
text: African American. Her office is cramped and run-down in a
text: cramped and run-down building. Stacks of folders piled high
text: in front of her.
text: She just sits behind her desk, waiting for his laughing fit
text: to end, she's been through this before. Finally it subsides.
text: Joker takes a deep breath, pauses to see if it's over.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: --is it just me, or is it getting
dialog: crazier out there?
text: Despite the laughter, there's real pain in his eyes.
text: Something broken in him. Looks like he hasn't slept in days.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: It's certainly tense. People are
text: upset, they're struggling. Looking
dialog: for work. The garbage strike seems
text: like it's been going on forever.
dialog: These are tough times.
dialog: (then)
dialog: How 'bout you. How's the job? Still
dialog: enjoying it?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Yeah, I mean, it's different each
dialog: day, so I really like that. I don't
dialog: think I could ever work in an
text: office. Behind a desk.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 2.
speaker_heading: JOKER (CONT'D)
dialog: (beat)
dialog: No offense.
text: She smiles. Writes something down. Looks at the clock, she's
text: running late for her next appointment.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: Have you been keeping up with your
dialog: journal?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Everyday.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: Great. Did you bring it with you?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (dodging the subject)
dialog: I'm sorry. Did I bring what?
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: (impatient; she doesn't
dialog: have time for this)
dialog: Arthur, last time I asked you to
dialog: bring your journal with you. For
dialog: these appointments. Do you have it?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Yes ma'am.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: Can I see it?
text: He reluctantly reaches into his bag. Pulls out a weathered
text: notebook. Slides it across to her--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I've been using it as a journal,
dialog: but also a joke diary. Funny
dialog: thoughts or, or observations-- Did
dialog: I tell you I'm pursuing a career in
dialog: stand-up comedy?
text: She's half-listening as she flips through his journal.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: No. You didn't.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I think I did.
dialog: 3.
text: She doesn't respond, keeps flipping through his journal--
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: Oh yeah. Because of what your
dialog: mother said,-- about your purpose.
dialog: "To bring laughter and joy to the
dialog: world," right?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Right.
text: ANGLE ON JOURNAL, pages and pages of notes, all in neat,
text: angry-looking handwriting. Also, cut out photos from hardcore
text: pornographic magazines and some crude handmade drawings.
text: A flash of anger crosses Joker's face. We see him picking at
text: his right eyebrow, almost obsessively. Trying to stay calm.
text: His eyebrow is actually half-gone. Something he does a lot.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I didn't realize you wanted to read
dialog: it.
text: The social worker gives him a look, then reads something in
text: the pages that gives her pause.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: (reading out loud)
dialog: "I just hope my death makes more
dialog: sense than my life."
text: She looks up at Joker. He just stares back. Lets it hang out
text: there for a beat.
text: Then he laughs a little, even though he doesn't think it's
dialog: funny--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Yeah. I mean, that's just--
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: Does my reading it upset you?
text: He leans in.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: No. I just,-- some of it's
dialog: personal. You know?
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: I understand. I just want to make
dialog: sure you're keeping up with it.
text: She slides his journal back to him. He holds it in his lap.
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: What about your mom? How's she
dialog: feeling?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: She has good days. But mostly bad.
dialog: It's been a big help having me
dialog: there. She really needs me.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: Seems like she's been sick a lot
dialog: since you got home.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Yeah, it's good I'm there. When I
dialog: was in the hospital, after my last
dialog: episode-- she was having trouble
dialog: getting over there to visit.
text: She looks back up at the clock, she needs to get to her next
dialog: appointment.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: All right. So, I'll see you again,
dialog: two weeks from today?
text: He nods. But keeps sitting there for a moment.
text: She stands up, trying to signal it's time for him to leave--
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: Is there something else I can help
dialog: you with, Arthur? My next
dialog: appointment is waiting.
text: He just keeps sitting there.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Yeah, I was wondering if you could
dialog: ask the doctor to increase the
dialog: dosage on my medications? Nothing
dialog: seems to make a difference.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: (looking over his record)
dialog: Do you know which ones you'd like
dialog: increased?
text: Shakes his head, no.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: Have you been sleeping?
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (lying)
dialog: Some.
text: She glances at his file again.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: Arthur, you're on seven different
dialog: medications. Surely they must be
dialog: doing something.
text: He finally stands up. Zips up his faded red sweatshirt.
dialog: Looks at her--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I just don't wanna feel so bad
dialog: anymore.
scene_heading: CUT TO BLACK:
speaker_heading: TITLE:
speaker_heading: JOKER
scene_heading: 2 EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE, MIDTOWN - KENNY'S MUSIC SHOP - DAY 2
text: GOTHAM SQUARE IS CLOGGED WITH TRAFFIC. Non-stop honking
text: horns, pedestrians crowding the sidewalk. Huge billboards,
text: giant movie marquees, garbage bags piled high everywhere.
text: Underneath it all we hear a TINKLING PIANO playing something
text: bouncy and fast-paced.
text: FROM ACROSS THE BUSY CITY STREET, we see Joker. He's dressed
text: as a sad-faced HOBO CLOWN. This is his job.
text: Dressed in tattered clothes, dark five o'clock shadow painted
text: on his face, big bulbous red nose, his mouth's outlined in
text: white, turned down at the corners.
text: He's holding up a sign in front of Kenny's Music Shop that
text: reads, "EVERYTHING MUST GO!" A banner above the store reads,
text: "GOING OUT OF BUSINESS!" Behind him, an OLD MAN plays a piano
text: on the street. Both of them there to draw attention to the
text: big sale going on in the store.
text: Joker's doing a little Charlie Chaplin like waddle to the
text: music. Most people walk right past, ignoring him. A few bump
text: into him by mistake.
text: JOKER SEES A GROUP OF FIVE BOYS, no more than 15-years-old,
text: walking toward him. He moves out of their way. They crack up
text: laughing when they see him. Start making fun of him.
dialog: 6.
text: Joker ignores them, tries to do his job the best he can while
text: maintaining some dignity. Keeps dancing and holding up the
dialog: sign.
text: One of the kids knocks the sign out of Joker's hands--
speaker_heading: KID #1
dialog: Suck my dick, clown.
text: The kids laugh. Joker doesn't say anything. Just bends over
dialog: to pick up the sign--
text: Another kid kicks him in the ass--
speaker_heading: KID #2
dialog: Whoops.
text: Joker falls face first onto the sidewalk. Oddly, the old man
text: playing the piano picks up the pace of the music--
text: The kids crack up. One of the boys grabs Joker's sign and
text: takes off running across the street--
text: The other kids follow, weaving through traffic--
text: Joker gets up and gives chase. He needs his sign back.
text: He almost gets hit by a taxi, spinning out of the way just in
text: time-- Spinning right into another taxi that stops just short
dialog: of hitting him.
text: Joker keeps running through traffic. People stare. A clown
dialog: barreling down the street has got to be a joke--
scene_heading: 3 EXT. CORNER, SIDE STREET - GOTHAM SQUARE - CONTINUOUS 3
text: The five boys are booking it down the crowded street laughing
text: and whooping it up. At the last second they take a sharp
text: right turn down a cross street--
text: Joker almost overshoots the corner, slip-sliding in his big
dialog: red shoes--
text: He rights himself and heads down after them--
dialog: Sees them running up ahead--
text: WHAP! Out of nowhere Joker gets hit in the face!
text: He falls to the ground.
text: One of the kids was hiding between parked cars and hit Joker
text: with the "EVERYTHING MUST GO!" sign, splintering it in two--
dialog: 7.
text: The other kids turn back and walk up to Joker down on the
dialog: ground.
text: Joker reaches out, still trying to save the sign--
text: THE KIDS START KICKING AND BEATING THE SHIT out of Joker.
text: It's brutal and vicious. Nobody on the street stops to help.
text: CLOSE ON JOKER'S HOBO CLOWN FACE, down on the ground. Sweat
text: running down his face, smearing his make-up. He doesn't even
text: look like he's in pain. He just takes the beating.
text: That stupid frown painted on his face.
scene_heading: 4 INT. CITY BUS (PULLING OUT) - HEADING DOWNTOWN - DUSK 4
text: Joker, makes his way toward the back of the crowded bus, now
text: walking with a slight limp, but keeping his head held high.
text: His make-up's washed off, costume and props all shoved into a
text: big shopping bag slung over his shoulder. Some white grease-
text: paint still smudged on the sides of his face.
text: He finds an empty seat in the back of the bus. Sees a sad-
text: eyed FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL, face puffy from crying, sitting on
text: her knees looking back at him. Her mother's facing forward,
text: but even from behind you can tell she's angry.
text: Joker sees the sad-eyed girl staring straight back at him. He
text: doesn't know where to look, feeling self-conscious and small.
text: He gets back into "character" smiling like a clown and covers
text: his face with his hands-- Starts playing the peek-a-boo game
dialog: with her.
text: The girl stares back at him for a moment then giggles--
speaker_heading: WOMAN ON BUS
dialog: (turns back to Joker;
dialog: already annoyed)
dialog: Can you please stop bothering my
dialog: kid?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I wasn't bothering her, I was--
speaker_heading: WOMAN ON BUS
dialog: (interrupts)
dialog: Just stop.
text: AND SUDDENLY JOKER STARTS TO LAUGH. LOUD. He covers his mouth
text: trying to hide it-- Shakes his head, laughter pausing for a
text: moment, but then it comes on stronger. His eyes are sad. It
text: actually looks like the laughter causes him pain.
dialog: 8.
text: People on the bus are staring. The girl looks like she's
text: going to cry again.
speaker_heading: WOMAN ON BUS
dialog: You think that's funny?
text: Joker shakes his head no, but he can't stop laughing. He
text: reaches in his pocket and pulls out a small card. Hands it to
dialog: the woman.
text: CLOSE ON THE CARD, it reads: "Forgive my laughter. I have a
dialog: condition (more on back)"
text: She turns the card over and there is a bunch of information
dialog: in small writing--
text: "It's a medical condition causing sudden, frequent, uncontrollable laughter that
dialog: doesn't match how you feel. It can happen in people with a brain injury or certain
dialog: neurological conditions."
dialog: She doesn't read it (but if you freeze frame the movie you
text: could). She just shakes her head annoyed and throws the card
text: on the ground.
text: Joker laughs harder. Tears running down his face.
dialog: Not wanting to attract any more attention to himself, he
text: pulls up his red hood, and uses his threadbare scarf to cover
text: his mouth, trying to muffle the laughter.
text: He looks out at the city passing him by.
scene_heading: 5 EXT. LOWER EAST SIDE, STREETS - GOTHAM - EVENING 5
text: The bus pulls away, sun almost gone.
text: Joker heads slowly down the litter-covered streets. Garbage
text: is piled along the sidewalks, the air thick with smog creates
text: a haze over everything.
text: The streets are crowded with the poor, the elderly and
text: disenfranchised. Women with children in busted strollers.
text: Homeless people sleeping on subway grates. Stray dogs. His is
text: one of the few white faces.
text: Joker makes his way into a run-down drug store, behind him
text: two drunks fight on the corner, beating the shit out of each
dialog: other. Joker, and nobody else for that matter, pays them any
dialog: attention.
dialog: No one here gives a shit.
dialog: 9.
scene_heading: 6 INT. LOBBY, APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING 6
text: A shabby lobby in a building that was once probably pretty
dialog: nice, but now it's a dump.
text: Joker checks his mailbox. He's holding a small white
text: (prescription) bag in his hand.
text: The mailbox is empty.
scene_heading: 7 INT. ELEVATOR, APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 7
text: Joker steps onto the wheezing elevator, harsh fluorescent
text: lights, graffiti on the walls. As the door closes, he hears--
speaker_heading: SOPHIE (OS)
dialog: Wait!!
text: He puts his foot out with some panache to stop the closing
dialog: door-- He's a romantic at heart. Ding.
text: And SOPHIE DUMOND (late 20's), tired eyes, hands filled with
text: grocery bags, steps onto the elevator with GIGI, her 5-year-
dialog: old daughter.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: Of course it's you,-- everyone else
dialog: in this building is just so fucking
dialog: rude.
text: Joker nods "thanks." Holds his breath, hoping he doesn't
text: start to laugh.
text: Floors dinging as the elevator rises.
text: Joker sees GiGi licking the dirty smudged elevator handrail
text: behind her mom.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: How's your mom doing?
text: He takes a deep breath, he's uncomfortable talking to her,
text: holds up the white prescription bag.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: It's day to day. I'm doing
dialog: everything I can to get her back on
dialog: her feet.
dialog: (re: pharmacy bag)
dialog: Picked up her medicine. Gonna make
dialog: her some dinner.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: (smiles; being polite)
dialog: She's lucky she has you--
text: Joker smiles thanks, can't help but glance at GiGi licking
dialog: the rail.
text: Sophie finally notices. She wants to grab her but can't with
text: her hands full. Tries to kick her away--
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Jesus. Don't do that, GiGi! How
dialog: many times have I told you that?
dialog: (to Joker)
dialog: This building is so awful, isn't
dialog: it?
text: Joker just nods... he doesn't know what to say, but clearly
dialog: wants to continue this conversation with Sophie.
text: The doors open. They all step off.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Okay. Well, tell your mom I said
dialog: hello.
text: And Sophie and GiGi walk down the hall-- the opposite way of
text: Joker. He just stands there for a beat. Heart beating fast.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (calls out after her)
dialog: Hey Sophie--
text: She turns around.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I'll tell my mom you said hello.
dialog: She smiles as in "yeah, that's what I said."
scene_heading: 8 INT. MOM'S APARTMENT, FRONT DOOR - EVENING 8
text: Old apartment, worn carpet. Nothing's new inside but it's
text: fairly neat and well-kept.
text: Joker closes the door behind him, leans his back against it
text: and swoons. Hears a deep purring sound. He looks down and
text: sees an OLD ORANGE CAT, rubbing up against his leg.
dialog: Then--
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: MOM (OS)
dialog: (shattering the moment,
dialog: calls out)
dialog: Happy?! Did you check the mail
dialog: before you came up?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Yes, Ma. Nothing. No letter.
speaker_heading: MOM (OS)
dialog: You sure you looked? Sometimes I
dialog: don't know where your head is.
text: Joker glances back down and sees the cat is gone.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Yes I'm sure. And my head's right
dialog: here. I'm gonna make you some
dialog: dinner, okay?
speaker_heading: QUICK CUTS:
text: JOKER TEARS OPEN THE PRESCRIPTION BAG... A FLURRY OF PILL
text: BOTTLES TUMBLE OUT ONTO THE COUNTER.
text: SEE HIS NAME, "ARTHUR FLECK" ON THE ORANGE PILL BOTTLES, AND
scene_heading: GLIMPSE THE GENERIC DRUG NAMES, TEMAZEPAM... PERPHENAZINE...
scene_heading: AHENELZINE... AMITRIPTYLINE... BENZEDRINE... DIAZEPAM...
text: MEPROBAMATE...
text: TAKES OUT ONE PILL FROM EACH THE TEMAZEPAM AND MEPROBAMATE
speaker_heading: BOTTLES.
text: TWO PILLS BEING CRUSHED UP TO POWDER.
text: SPRINKLES THE POWDER ON TOP OF A TV DINNER.
text: SWALLOWS A HANDFUL OF PILLS FROM THE OTHER BOTTLES.
text: LOOKS DOWN AND SMILES AT THE ORANGE CAT LOOKING UP AT HIM
text: FROM THE COUNTER.
scene_heading: 9 INT. MOM'S BEDROOM, APARTMENT - NIGHT 9
text: Joker brings the food to his mother, PENNY (70's), lying in
text: her bed. The TV is on, playing the local news.
text: Joker sets the food down in front of his mother. He covers
text: the pain from his beating the best he can-- His mother
text: doesn't seem to notice anyway.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: He must not be getting my letters.
dialog: 12.
text: Joker sits down on a chair next to the bed.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: He's a busy man.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Too busy for me? I worked for that
dialog: family for 12 years. He always had
dialog: a smile for me. Least he could do
text: is write back.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Ma, eat. You need to eat.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: You need to eat. Look how skinny
dialog: you are.
text: Before Joker can say anything, his mother points to the news
dialog: on the TV--
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: All day long it's more bad news.
dialog: That's all there is.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Maybe you shouldn't watch so much
dialog: television.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: (ignoring)
dialog: He's the only hope for Gotham.
dialog: He'll make a great mayor. Everybody
dialog: says so.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (playful)
dialog: Everybody who? Who do you talk to?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Well everybody on the news.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Stop it. He's not even gonna run.
dialog: Why would Thomas Wayne want to be
dialog: mayor? He can do more good as a
dialog: businessman.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Because he cares about this city.
dialog: And everyone in it-- that's why I
dialog: can't believe he hasn't written me
dialog: back.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: He will. Now eat some dinner.
text: He feeds her a bite of the food.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: How you feeling today?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: I don't know. It always hits me
dialog: worse at night, you notice that?
text: He shakes his head.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (teasing)
dialog: Maybe it's the moon. Maybe you're a
dialog: werewolf?
text: HE HOWLS SOFTLY like a wolf. She laughs.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: It's not funny.
text: Joker watches her as he cuts up some more of her food.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Anyway, I wrote a new letter today.
dialog: A better one. I want you to hand
dialog: deliver it to him.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: What? Why?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Cause maybe the mailman is throwing
dialog: them away. We should have tipped
dialog: him at Christmas time.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Who tips their mailman?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Some people do. Rich people do.
text: Joker sighs, resigned.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Okay. I can try his office.
dialog: Tomorrow.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: (she pats the bed)
dialog: Come sit. It's almost on.
text: Joker gets into bed with her.
text: CLOSE ON TELEVISION, intro to "LIVE WITH MURRAY FRANKLIN!",
text: and we HEAR THE ANNOUNCER over clips of comedy bits, stars
dialog: and Murray Franklin himself--
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (ON TV)
dialog: It's Live with Murray Franklin!

dialog: Winger, comedian Skip Byron and the
dialog: piano stylings of Yeldon &amp; Chantel!
dialog: As always, Don Ellis and his Jazz
dialog: Orchestra. And now, without any
dialog: further ado-- Murray Franklin!
text: Joker and his mom watch from bed, this is a ritual of theirs.
scene_heading: 10 INT. LIVING ROOM, MOM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 10
text: Late night. Joker's mom is dead asleep. Joker is alone in the
text: living room, which doubles as his bedroom. He can't ever
text: sleep. He opens his worn notebook. Flips to a page titled
dialog: "Jokes" and starts writing--
text: CLOSE ON WORDS, as he slowly writes: "The worst part about
dialog: having a mental illness is..."
text: ANGLE ON JOKER, pausing, thinking it over for a moment. Then
text: he laughs to himself when he comes up with something.
text: CLOSE ON WORDS, coming faster now, "...that people still
dialog: expect you to behave as if you don't."
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 11 EXT. WAYNE TOWER, STREET - MIDTOWN - MORNING 11
text: Joker's looking up at the intimidating steel and glass tower,
text: he looks so small, holding his mom's letter in his hand.
text: Bustle of professionals coming in and out of the company's
text: corporate headquarters, Joker looks out of place.
text: He heads inside through the giant glass doors.
dialog: 15.
scene_heading: 12 INT. RECEPTION, WAYNE ENTERPRISES - 25TH FLOOR - MORNING 12
text: Joker steps off an elevator and walks up to the white marble
text: reception desk as if he belongs there--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Hello. I have a personal letter for
dialog: Mr. Thomas Wayne.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Okay. You can leave it with me.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: It's kind of important. I need to
dialog: make sure he gets it himself.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Oh, in that case, I'll buzz you
dialog: right in.
dialog: Joker goes to enter--
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: I'm kidding. Leave it here.
text: He laughs along with her, even though she's not laughing.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Oh. Right-- well, my mom used to
dialog: work for the Wayne family-- for 12
dialog: years. She was their housekeeper.
text: A couple other business people are now waiting behind Joker,
dialog: there for meetings.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: That's great. But you can leave it
dialog: with me or you can leave with the
dialog: letter. Those are your options. Now
dialog: please step aside.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Mr. Wayne knows her. Can you maybe
dialog: at least call back to him? Tell him
dialog: that I'm here.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
text: Thomas Wayne is away on business.
text: Joker is getting frustrated.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Okay. Well, can I have your name?
dialog: So I know who I left it with.
dialog: 16.
text: Now Joker sees a GROUP OF MEN walking behind the glass that
text: separates the reception area from the back offices. Amongst
text: the group, he catches a glimpse of THOMAS WAYNE (60's), deep
text: tan, hair dyed so black it's almost blue.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Wait. He's right there.
dialog: (goes up to the glass,
dialog: shouts)
dialog: Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne.
text: He starts banging on the glass... but the group keeps moving.
text: Not noticing him.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Sir. Please stop. Sir!!
text: Joker keeps banging on the glass.
scene_heading: 13 EXT. WAYNE TOWER, FRONT ENTRANCE - MORNING 13
text: The glass doors swing open and Joker is forcibly thrown onto
text: the street. TWO LARGE SECURITY GUARDS stand over him.
text: He is still holding the letter.
text: He makes as if he's going to leave peacefully, then at the
text: last minute, TAKES ANOTHER RUN AT THE DOOR--
text: The two guards stiff arm him.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 14 INT. HA-HA'S TALENT BOOKING, LOCKER ROOM - DAY 14
text: The cramped locker room of a small talent booking agency.
dialog: This is where Joker works. They "rent out" talent for parties
text: and events. Clowns, magicians, male strippers.
text: Joker takes off his shirt, grimaces in pain as he moves. His
text: body's bruised from the beating he took chasing after his
dialog: sign.
speaker_heading: RANDALL (OS)
dialog: You okay?
text: He turns. RANDALL (mid 50's), a big bear of a know-it-all,
text: standing there. He's a party clown as well. He's half-dressed
text: in his clown suit.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: I heard about the beat down you
dialog: took. Fucking savages.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: It was just a bunch of kids. I
dialog: should have left it alone.
text: Randall opens his locker--
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: It's crazy out there. And it's only
dialog: getting worse.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (nods)
dialog: My mother says that the people
dialog: nowadays lack empathy.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: What's empathy?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: It means like "feeling for other
dialog: people."
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: Like sympathy?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Kind of. But different.
text: Randall comes over, hands Joker a brown paper bag-- Joker
text: looks inside. It's a GUN, a .38 snub-nose revolver.
text: Joker looks up at him, confused--
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: Take it. I got a few. You gotta
dialog: protect yourself out there, buddy.
dialog: Too many wackos.
text: As Joker stares at it--
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: (lowers his voice)
dialog: It's a .38 snub-nose. Gets the job
dialog: done if you ever need to use it.
dialog: Usually pulling it out is enough.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I, I don't have the money for this,
dialog: Randall.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: Don't sweat it. You can pay me some
dialog: other time. You're my boy.
text: That lands with Joker, he smiles to himself.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: (as he walks away)
dialog: But you didn't get it from me,
dialog: okay?
text: Joker nods. Puts the brown paper bag in his locker. Slowly
text: starts to get dressed-- his eyes darting toward the bag as he
dialog: does.
text: Another clown, GARY (30's), a dwarf, pops his head into the
text: locker room.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Arthur,-- Hoyt wants to see you in
dialog: his office.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: No clue.
scene_heading: 15 INT. FRONT OFFICE, HA-HA'S TALENT BOOKING - DAY 15
text: Joker still half-dressed, walks into the cramped office.
text: His boss, HOYT VAUGHN (60's) sits behind a metal desk. The
text: office is a complete mess, newspapers and files litter the
text: desk. A giant ashtray filled with cigarette butts. A calendar
text: of booking hangs on the wall. A scribbled, jumbled mess.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Hey Hoyt. Gary said you wanted to
dialog: see me?
speaker_heading: HOYT
dialog: (without even looking up)
dialog: How's the comedy career? Are you a
dialog: famous stand-up yet?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Not quite. Haven't even performed
dialog: yet. Just been working my material.
dialog: This business is all about fine-
dialog: tuning.
text: Now Hoyt looks up. Takes a drag from his cigarette.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: HOYT
dialog: Right.
dialog: Joker goes to sit down--
speaker_heading: HOYT
dialog: Don't sit. This will be quick.
text: Joker stops in his tracks.
speaker_heading: HOYT
dialog: Look, I like you, Arthur. A lot of
dialog: the guys here, they think you're a
dialog: freak. But I like you. I don't even
dialog: know why I like you. I mean, you
dialog: don't say much.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's probably that stupid laugh. It
dialog: gets me every time. Kills me.
text: Unsure how to respond, Joker just nods.
speaker_heading: HOYT
dialog: But I got another complaint. And
dialog: it's starting to piss me off.
text: Joker takes a deep breath, maybe picks at his eyebrow.
speaker_heading: HOYT
dialog: Kenny's Music. Sunday. The guy said
dialog: you disappeared. Never even
text: returned his sign.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: No. I got jumped. I told you about
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: HOYT
dialog: For a sign? Bullshit. It makes no
dialog: sense, just give him his sign back.
dialog: He's going out of business for
dialog: god's--
text: BANG! Out of nowhere, Joker slams his head into the wall.
text: Head-butting it hard.
speaker_heading: HOYT
dialog: (taken aback)
dialog: Hey!
text: BANG! BANG! He does it two more times. Breaking the plaster
dialog: on the wall--
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: HOYT
dialog: What the fuck, Arthur?!
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (voice tightens)
dialog: I don't have his sign.
text: And Joker just stares at Hoyt, some blood forming on his
dialog: forehead--
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 16 EXT. BACK ALLEY, OUTSIDE HA-HA'S - AMUSEMENT MILE - DAY 16
text: WE'RE AT THE FAR END OF AN ALLEY, about halfway down, catch a
text: glimpse of Joker still half-dressed on the other side of a
text: dumpster. From this vantage, all we can see is him furiously
text: KICKING and STOMPING on something... or somebody.
text: We don't hear anything. And we can't make out what it is that
text: he's so violently beating down.
dialog: It could be a cat... a cardboard box... a homeless person...
dialog: We don't know.
text: Joker just continues unleashing his rage--
scene_heading: 17 INT. CITY BUS (MOVING) - DUSK 17
text: Joker at the end of his work day, sitting in his spot toward
text: the back of the bus.
text: Across the aisle from him, he's innocently watching a young
text: couple, playfully teasing each other.
scene_heading: 18 EXT. GOTHAM, LOWER EAST SIDE - EVENING 18
text: Joker heading back home down the litter-covered streets like

text: He's carrying the paper bag that Randall gave him.
scene_heading: 19 INT. LOBBY, APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING 19
text: Joker checks his mailbox. Empty.

scene_heading: 20 INT. ELEVATOR, APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 20
text: Joker is on the elevator, as the door closes, he sticks his
text: foot out to stop it.
text: The door limps back open. Ding.
text: He looks to see if anybody, if Sophie, is coming. He waits.
dialog: Hoping.
text: The door starts to close on him again-- Right before it does,
text: he stops it with his foot again. Ding.
scene_heading: 21 INT. MOM'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - NIGHT 21

speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: --so what did he say when you gave
dialog: him the letter?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: They wouldn't let me see him.
dialog: (lying)
dialog: But they promised me it would get
dialog: to him.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: It's good they promised. He only
dialog: works with the best. We should hear
dialog: something soon.
text: He fills an empty plastic container with some bath water.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Look up.
text: She tilts her head back and he rinses her hair with the water
dialog: from the container...
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Why are these letters so important
dialog: to you, Ma? What do you think he's
dialog: gonna do?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: He's gonna help us.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Help us how?
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Get us out of here, take me away
dialog: from this place and these-- these
dialog: awful people.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: You worked for him over 30 years
dialog: ago. What makes you think he would
dialog: help you?
text: She looks at him with conviction.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Because Thomas Wayne is a good man.
dialog: If he knew how I was living, if he
dialog: saw this place, it would make him
dialog: sick. I can't explain it to you any
dialog: better than that.
text: Joker nods. Annoyed, but not worth the argument. He stands up
dialog: to get her a towel.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I don't want you worrying about
dialog: money. Everyone's been telling me
dialog: they think my stand-up is ready for
dialog: the big clubs. It's just a matter
dialog: of time before I get a break.
text: She steps into the towel. He's helping dry her off.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Happy, what makes you think you
dialog: could do that?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: I mean, don't you have to be funny
dialog: to be a comedian?
dialog: Beat.

dialog: 23.
scene_heading: 23 INT. LIVING ROOM, MOM'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 23
text: Joker sits on the couch. The TV is on, but the sound is off.
text: He holds the .38 SNUB-NOSE REVOLVER Randall gave him in his
text: hand. He's never held a gun before, looks uncomfortable with
text: it, the weight of it in his hand...
text: He points it at the TV, hand trembling a bit... Points it at
text: the cat... Points it at his head.
text: Looks closely at the grip. The barrel. The cylinder. Now he
text: casually pulls the trigger--
speaker_heading: BLAMMMMMMM!
text: He jumps up off the couch. What the fuck!? He looks around in
text: a panic. His hands shaking.
text: He shot a hole in the wall.
speaker_heading: MOM (OS)
dialog: (awoken by the shot)
dialog: HAPPY!? What was that?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: What?!
text: He quickly turns up the TV volume. REALLY LOUD. Shoves the
text: still smoking gun under the couch cushions.
speaker_heading: MOM (OS)
dialog: THAT NOISE! DID YOU HEAR THAT
speaker_heading: NOISE?
text: He's inspecting the hole in the wall. Shouts back over the TV
dialog: noise--
speaker_heading: JOKER
text: I'M WATCHING AN OLD WAR MOVIE.
speaker_heading: MOM (OS)
dialog: TURN IT DOWN!
text: He heads for his mother's bedroom.
scene_heading: 24 INT. MOM'S BEDROOM, DOORWAY - CONTINUOUS 24
text: Joker looks in on his mom in her dark bedroom, can make out
text: the outline of her body sitting up.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: It's so loud.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I know. The Americans are really
dialog: giving it to the Japs.
text: He walks over to her in the darkness. Kisses her on the
dialog: forehead.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (softly)
dialog: I'm sorry. I'll turn it down.
scene_heading: 25 INT. KITCHEN, MOM'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT 25
text: Joker is writing in his journal. He speaks softly to himself
dialog: as he writes...
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Why didn't Randall tell me the gun
dialog: was loaded? He's my friend. With my
dialog: luck, I could have killed someone.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I could have killed myself.
text: CLOSE ON THE LAST LINE, he crosses out "could"...
dialog: Writes... "should".
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (still to himself)
dialog: I should have killed myself.
text: CLOSE ON JOKER as he crosses out something again...
speaker_heading: JOKER

text: HANDHELD POV, see the run-down building where Joker lives
text: from across the street.
text: REVEAL, Joker is watching his own building on the far side of
text: a parked truck. Red hood pulled up, covering his head. He
text: waits. Watches.
text: Now we see Sophie exiting the building with her daughter
dialog: GiGi. Sophie's dressed more conservatively than when we
dialog: previously met her.
dialog: 25.
text: Joker starts following them.
scene_heading: 27 EXT. PUBLIC SCHOOL - MORNING 27

scene_heading: 29 INT. SUBWAY (MOVING) - MORNING 29
text: Joker stands at the window between two subway cars. Just
text: watching Sophie as she reads a book in the next car.
text: The train comes to a stop and she exits. Joker exits as well.
scene_heading: 30 EXT. STREET, UPPER EAST SIDE - MORNING 30
text: Nicer part of Gotham. Joker follows Sophie from a distance,

text: Sees her say hello to the guard. This is where she works.
text: Joker just watches and waits.
scene_heading: 31 INT. GOTHAM FIRST NATIONAL - LATER 31
text: A large, mid-level bank. Sophie is one of THREE BANK TELLERS
text: working behind the plexiglass windows.
text: Joker pulls the hood back off his head, takes a deep breath
text: before he walks up to her window. She is looking down,
text: counting her drawer.
text: Takes another deep breath. Then--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Hello. I'd like to open an account.
text: She looks up.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Hey, what are you doing up here?
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Oh, hi. That's weird.
dialog: (pausing to see if he's
dialog: gonna laugh; he's good)
dialog: I didn't know you worked at a bank.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Pretty glamorous, right?
text: Not getting the sarcasm, Joker nods. Looks around.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Very glamorous. Look at this place.
text: She laughs.
text: He stands there awkwardly for a moment looking around to see
text: what she's laughing about.
text: Realizes she thought he was making a joke.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I'm a comedian. I do stand-up
dialog: comedy.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Really? I had no idea.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Yeah. You know, I'm always making
dialog: funny observations. Always on the
dialog: look out for my next bit-- so it
dialog: makes sense.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Right. Anyway, is there something I
dialog: could help you with?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I said hi to my mom.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Last week. You said to say hi to my
dialog: mom. I did. Made her day.
text: They are interrupted by the BRANCH MANAGER (50's), white,
text: heavy-set, who has come up behind Sophie--
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: BRANCH MANAGER
dialog: Everything okay here?
text: He puts his heavy hand on Sophie's shoulder. She practically
text: shudders from his touch.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Everything is fine Mr. Slotnick.
text: Now he leans down and whispers something in her ear-- Joker
text: just watches through the glass.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
text: (shakes her head; to her
dialog: manager)
dialog: No. He's not. He's interested in
dialog: opening an account.
speaker_heading: BRANCH MANAGER
dialog: (to Joker)
dialog: Great. You just need to fill out a
dialog: form. They are back there-- against
dialog: the wall.
text: As the manager talks, Sophie makes wide eyes at Joker, like
dialog: "I almost got in trouble."
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (covering; trying to act
dialog: cool)
dialog: Okay. Thank you, sir. And thank you
dialog: as well, Miss.
text: Joker walks back to the wall by the forms.
text: He fumbles around for a minute, clearly not there to open an
text: account. He begins filling out a form. Then--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (shouts out, to no one in
dialog: particular)
dialog: YOU KNOW WHAT?! I FORGOT MY ID!
dialog: I'LL BE BACK. THANK YOU.
text: He walks out of the bank. Head in the clouds.
scene_heading: 32 INT. GOTHAM COMEDY CLUB, CHINATOWN - NIGHT 32
text: Joker sitting in the middle of a dark, crowded comedy club.
text: People on dates. Groups of friends. All here to watch the

text: act on stage.
dialog: 28.
text: The comic on stage is killing it. The whole room is laughing
text: and applauding. Everyone except Joker.
text: He's watching. Studying. Diligently jotting down notes in his
dialog: notebook.
scene_heading: 33 EXT. GOTHAM COMEDY CLUB, STREET - CHINATOWN - NIGHT 33
text: People are piling out of the club, onto the narrow street,
text: jumble of lit-up signs, most glowing yellow or red. Joker

scene_heading: 34 INT. HA-HA'S TALENT BOOKING, LOCKER ROOM - DAY 34
text: Joker is working on his "Mr. Jingles" clown look, using the
text: small mirror in his locker. Behind him a couple of other
text: clowns are eating their lunch at a small table, not paying
dialog: Joker any attention.
text: Joker pauses half-finished, and stares at himself for a beat.
text: He starts to examine the two small scars on the corners of
text: his mouth, we really notice how they form a smile. Joker
text: hooks the corners of his mouth down with his index fingers,
text: turning his smile into a frown--
text: He lets go and his smile returns.
text: Does it again, up and down, up and down, his face a living
dialog: comedy/tragedy mask.
text: And then he pulls his fingers wider, stretching his smile
text: into a grotesque parody, pulling his mouth so wide tears come
dialog: to his eyes--
text: AND WE HEAR JOKER SINGING "If You're Happy and You Know It"
text: at his next gig.
speaker_heading: JOKER (PRE-LAP)
dialog: (singing)

text: costume. A few nurses and doctors watch as well.
text: His white clown face, mouth outlined in black and filled in
text: with red, his green wig frizzy and worn out. Joker plays a
text: UKULELE along with the song.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: If you're happy and you know it,
dialog: stomp your feet.
text: Joker and the kids stomp and sing along.
speaker_heading: JOKER

dialog: (stomp, stomp)
dialog: If you're happy and you know it and
dialog: you really want to show it, if
dialog: you're happy and you know it stomp
dialog: your feet.
text: As the song winds down, the KIDS and NURSES clap.

text: And as he does, his .38 SNUB-NOSE REVOLVER slips out of his
text: pants and slides across the floor.
text: Everyone stops. Looks at the gun on the floor.
scene_heading: 36 INT. LOBBY, GOTHAM GENERAL - LATER 36

speaker_heading: JOKER

dialog: Hoyt, let me explain.
speaker_heading: HOYT (OVER PHONE)
dialog: Oh, this'll be good. Please tell me
dialog: why you brought a gun into a sick
dialog: kid's ward?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: It was, it was a prop gun. It's
dialog: part of my act now.
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: HOYT (OVER PHONE)
dialog: Bullshit. Jingles would never carry
dialog: a fucking gun. Besides, Randall
dialog: told me you tried to buy a .38 off
dialog: him last week.
text: Joker's taken aback that Randall would do that to him.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Randall told you that?
speaker_heading: HOYT (OVER PHONE)
dialog: He was with me when the call came
dialog: in. You're a fuck up, Arthur. And a
dialog: liar. You're fired.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hoyt--
speaker_heading: HOYT (OVER PHONE)
dialog: Say it, Arthur.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Let me hear you say it.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Say what?
speaker_heading: HOYT (OVER PHONE)
dialog: I'm a fuck up and I'm fired.
text: Joker picks at his eyebrow.
speaker_heading: JOKER

dialog: --I'm a fuck up and I'm fired.
speaker_heading: HOYT (OVER PHONE)
dialog: Louder.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (into phone; louder)
dialog: I'm a fuck up and I'm fired.
speaker_heading: HOYT (OVER PHONE)
dialog: Yes. You are.

scene_heading: 37 INT. SUBWAY (MOVING) - NIGHT 37
text: JOKER SITS ON THE SUBWAY CONTEMPLATING WHAT JUST WENT DOWN,
text: face still painted, his bag on the seat next to him, along
text: with his wig.
text: There's only one other person on the subway car, a YOUNG
text: WOMAN (30's) sitting at the far end-- reading a book.
text: The train comes to a stop and THREE WALL STREET GUYS enter.
text: They are being loud and obnoxious, clearly drunk. One of them
text: is eating some french fries out of a greasy McDonald's bag.
text: He flops down on the bench across from the girl and checks
text: her out. The other two guys start getting into it with each
dialog: other--
speaker_heading: WALL STREET #1
dialog: --I'm telling you, she wanted my
dialog: number. We should have just stayed.
text: The train starts moving again...
speaker_heading: WALL STREET #2
dialog: You're dreaming, man. She wasn't
dialog: interested-- at all.
speaker_heading: WALL STREET #1
dialog: Are you nuts? Did you see how close
dialog: we were dancing!? She was in love,
dialog: bro.
text: He starts dancing a bit with himself, mimicking what he
text: remembers. Wall Street #2 takes a swig from the brown bag he
text: is carrying.
speaker_heading: WALL STREET #2
dialog: She couldn't wait to get away from
dialog: you.
text: Joker is watching them closely, impressed by their confidence
dialog: and easy-going camaraderie.
speaker_heading: WALL STREET #1
dialog: (to the third guy)
dialog: Ryan, am I crazy? Tell him what you
dialog: saw.
dialog: But the third Wall Street guy isn't paying his friends any
text: attention. He has his eyes set on the young woman sitting
text: across from him, reading her book.
speaker_heading: WALL STREET #3
dialog: (to the girl)
dialog: Hey. You want some french fries?
dialog: 32.
text: He holds out his McDonald's bag and shakes it to get her
text: attention. The other two share a look. Joker watches from his
dialog: seat.
speaker_heading: WALL STREET #3
dialog: Hello? I'm talking to you. You want
dialog: some fries?
text: She looks up and shakes her head, polite smile.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: No thank you.
text: The other two guys crack up at this apparent blow-off. The
text: third Wall Street guy shakes his head, embarrassed, and
text: starts softly flinging fries at the young woman.
speaker_heading: WALL STREET #3
dialog: You sure? They're really good.
text: She just buries her face deeper in her book--
speaker_heading: WALL STREET #2
dialog: Don't ignore him. He's being nice
dialog: to you.
text: One of the french fries lands in her hair. She looks down
text: toward Joker, looking to see if he's going to do something or
dialog: say something--
text: Joker just sits there nervous. Not sure what to do, or even
dialog: if he wants to do anything at all.
text: AND HE JUST BURSTS OUT LAUGHING. He covers his mouth with his
text: hand as they continue to harass the woman.
dialog: They all look over-- What the fuck is this clown laughing at?
speaker_heading: WALL STREET #1
dialog: Something funny, asshole?
text: With their attention diverted, the young woman rushes out
text: through the door between subway cars, glancing back at Joker
dialog: before she goes--
speaker_heading: WALL STREET #3
dialog: (shouts after her)
speaker_heading: BITCH!
text: Joker laughs even harder through his hand. The Wall Street
text: guys turn to him sitting by himself at the end of the car--
dialog: 33.
text: Joker sees them staring. Looks down at the ground, hand still
text: covering his mouth, face turning red. Subway swaying, lights
text: flickering on and off.
dialog: Beat.
text: One of the guys heads down the car toward Joker, starts
text: singing "Send in the Clowns" as he approaches--
speaker_heading: WALL STREET #1
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Isn't it rich?
dialog: Are we a pair?
dialog: Me here, at last on the ground
dialog: You in mid-air
dialog: Send in the clowns.
text: The others crack up and follow after him. The guy plops down
text: next to Joker, puts his arm around his shoulder as he sings--
speaker_heading: JOKER
text: (shakes his head, stifling
dialog: the laughter)
dialog: Please. Don't.
speaker_heading: WALL STREET #1
dialog: (continues singing to him)
dialog: Isn't it bliss?
dialog: Don't you approve?
text: One who keeps tearing around,
dialog: One who can't move.
text: Joker starts to get up-- The lead guy pulls him back down.
speaker_heading: WALL STREET #1
dialog: Where are the clowns?
dialog: There ought to be clowns.
text: As he finishes the song, Joker's laughing fit is coming to an
text: end. One of the other guys sits down on the other side of
text: him. He's now sandwiched in between them--
speaker_heading: WALL STREET #2
dialog: So tell us, buddy. What's so
dialog: fucking funny?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Nothing. I have a condition--
text: Joker reaches into his bag to get one of his "Forgive my
text: laughter" cards, the third guy sees him reaching and tries to
dialog: grab the bag from him---
dialog: Joker pulls on it--
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: No. It's just my stuff. I don't
dialog: have anything.
text: The guy rips the bag from his hand--
speaker_heading: WALL STREET #3
dialog: I'll tell you what you have,
dialog: asshole.
text: Joker gets up from between them to go grab his bag back. The
text: two guys are cracking up.
speaker_heading: WALL STREET #3
dialog: You want it back? Here--
text: Joker reaches out to grab the bag--
text: And the guy tosses it over his head to one of his friends.
text: Keeping it away from Joker.
text: Three guys in suits tossing a bag around, playing 'monkey in
text: the middle' with a clown. THE LIGHTS ON THE TRAIN SEEM TO
text: GLOW BRIGHTER AND WE HEAR the drum roll opening to BOBBY
text: SHORT singing "Send in the Clowns" Live at the Café Carlyle.
text: Joker keeps trying to catch his bag until suddenly--
text: WHAP! Out of nowhere one of the guys punches him hard in the
dialog: face.
text: Joker goes down as if in slow motion. Blood coming from his
text: nose. He tries to get up, but his feet slip from under him
text: and he falls back down--
speaker_heading: WALL STREET #1
dialog: Stay down you freak.
text: And the third Wall Street guy starts kicking him--
text: The others join in. Surrounding Joker on the ground, kicking
text: him deliberately, sadistically, and the music swells--
speaker_heading: BLAM!
text: SUDDENLY THE LIGHTS GO BACK DIM, and one of the guys stops
text: kicking and falls back dead. Blood splattering on the subway
text: wall behind him--
text: And we HEAR Bobby Short sing out, picking up from where the
dialog: Wall Street Guy left off--
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: BOBBY SHORT (SINGING)
dialog: Just when I'd stopped opening doors
dialog: Finally knowin' the one that I
dialog: wanted was yours
text: BLAM! BLAM! Wall Street #2 goes down--
text: Revealing Joker on the ground, opening his eyes to see what
text: he did, smoking gun in his hand--
speaker_heading: BOBBY SHORT (SINGING)
dialog: Making my entrance again with my
dialog: usual flair
dialog: Sure of my lines
dialog: No one is there
text: The third guy takes off running for the doors that separate
dialog: the cars.
text: Joker starts after him, but then stops... turns back to grab
text: his bag and his wig, his hands shaking from the adrenaline.
text: The train is coming to a stop.
speaker_heading: BOBBY SHORT (SINGING)
dialog: Don't you love farce?
dialog: My fault I fear...
text: Joker picks up his bag between the two dead bodies, blood
dialog: everywhere...
text: The subway doors wheeze open and Joker steps halfway off the
text: train, waiting to see if the third Wall Street guy gets off
text: in the car ahead of him. Joker sees him run off--
scene_heading: 38 EXT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS 38
text: The platform is empty, the Wall Street guy is running toward
dialog: the stairs--
dialog: Joker follows--
text: Behind them, the train pulls away--
speaker_heading: BOBBY SHORT (SINGING)
dialog: I thought that you'd want what I
dialog: want.
dialog: Sorry, my dear.
text: The guy makes his way to the stairs, unaware that Joker is
dialog: behind him--
speaker_heading: BLAM!
dialog: 36.
text: The third guy falls, tumbling down the stairs. Joker walks
text: over to the body and empties the chamber-- BLAM! BLAM!
speaker_heading: BOBBY SHORT (SINGING)
dialog: But where are the clowns?
dialog: Quick, send in the clowns
dialog: Don't bother they're here.
text: And as "Send in the Clowns" ends, Joker fires the last shot--
dialog: BLAM! He's got nothing left.
scene_heading: 39 EXT. STREET, ROBINSON SQUARE PARK - NIGHT 39
text: Joker hauls ass out of the subway and makes a mad dash across
text: a busy street, horns honking--
text: Running as fast as he can past piles of garbage, he takes a
text: sharp turn high-tailing into a small, run-down needle park,
text: disappearing into the darkness.
scene_heading: 40 INT. PUBLIC BATHROOM, ROBINSON SQUARE PARK - NIGHT 40
text: Joker runs into the bathroom, locks the door behind him and
text: SUDDENLY EVERYTHING HITS HIM ALL AT ONCE--
text: He throws up into the dirty toilet, puking his guts out--
text: He finishes, wipes his mouth with the back of his hand. And
text: pulls the gun out of his waist, looking around for someplace
text: to throw it out. Under the sink he sees a rusted, metal grate
text: hanging off the wall covering some pipes.
text: Before he bends down, Joker catches his reflection in the
text: smudged mirror. Sees himself holding the gun in his hand--
dialog: Beat.
text: He raises the gun to his head and pulls the trigger--
dialog: Click.
text: It's empty.
text: He gets down on his knees, sweat dripping off his face, pulls
text: the grate away from the wall. And tosses the gun away inside.
text: Moves the grate back in place.
text: Joker stands back up and turns on the faucets. Rinses out his
dialog: mouth.
text: Looks at his smudged reflection as he starts washing the
text: clown make-up off his sweaty face--
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Hi. Do you like to laugh?
text: Water dripping, white grease paint running off his face--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Remember how I told you that I'm a
dialog: stand-up comedian?
dialog: (again)
dialog: Hi. How are you?
dialog: Beat.
scene_heading: 41 INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, LOBBY - LATER 41
text: Joker enters his building with great urgency. No time for the
text: elevator, he takes the stairs. Two at a time.
text: He races up the stairwell.
scene_heading: 42 INT. HALLWAY, APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 42
text: When he gets to his floor, instead of making a left toward
text: his apartment-- He makes a right, toward Sophie's. He stops
text: at her door. Out of breath.
text: Knocks.
text: He hears footsteps. Quickly pulls the folded-up flyer out of
text: his pocket.
text: The peephole in the door goes dark and then light again. He
text: hears locks unlocking. Sophie opens the door halfway--
text: Joker looks down at his feet--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Hi. Do you like to laugh?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (continuing without taking
dialog: a breath)
dialog: Remember the other day when I told
dialog: you about my stand-up comedy. Well,
dialog: I'm doing a set next Thursday and
dialog: I'm inviting a bunch of my friends
dialog: and I was wondering if maybe you
dialog: wanted to come and check it out.
dialog: 38.
text: He reaches out to give Sophie the flyer, she opens the door
text: wider-- He notices her face, sees her eyes are red.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Were you crying? Why are you
dialog: crying?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I had a bad day.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I'm sorry. I, I didn't--
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: It's okay. How would you know.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I got fired. From the bank.
text: Joker takes a deep breath and smiles without realizing it,
text: hoping he doesn't start to laugh.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Because,-- I don't know. It doesn't
dialog: fucking matter. I don't know what
dialog: I'm gonna do.
text: And she starts crying again. Joker doesn't move. Just stands
text: in the doorway awkward.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (finally)
dialog: Okay. Well, all the info is right
text: there on the flyer.
text: He starts to walk away, then turns back to her--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: You know they say laughter is the
dialog: best medicine.
text: Sophie wipes her eyes and manages a smile.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Is that what they say?
dialog: 39.
text: Joker just nods yes and walks back toward his mother's
dialog: apartment.
scene_heading: 43 INT. DEPT. OF HEALTH, OFFICE - MORNING 43
text: JOKER SITS ACROSS from the same Social Worker from the
text: opening scene. Same depressing office.
text: She stares at him for a beat, clearly annoyed.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: We spoke about this last time,
dialog: Arthur. You're supposed to bring
dialog: your journal with you.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Well I didn't think you were going
dialog: to read it.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: You said it didn't bother you.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I lied. Everything bothers me.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: What about it bothered you?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: It's personal. It's my private
dialog: thoughts. Plus it contains original
dialog: comedy material that I don't feel
dialog: comfortable handing over to you.
text: She looks at him and shakes her head. Not in the mood to deal
dialog: with this.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: Arthur, I have some bad news for
dialog: you.
text: He looks up, intrigued.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: They've cut our funding. We're
dialog: closing down our offices next week.
text: He looks around, just noticing some MOVING BOXES stacked
text: against the wall.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: So where will we be meeting?
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: We won't be. The city's cut funding
dialog: across the board. Social services
dialog: is part of that.
text: Joker nods, not hating the idea.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: SOCIAL WORKER
dialog: They don't give a shit about people
dialog: like you, Arthur. You don't have a
dialog: voice and they don't really care
dialog: what happens to you or to us for
dialog: that matter.
text: He sits there for a moment. And then it dawns on him--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: How am I gonna get my medication?
dialog: Beat.
scene_heading: 44 INT. MOM'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN - MORNING 44
text: CLOSE ON A COUPLE OF PILLS, as they get crushed up.
text: CLOSE ON THE RESIDUE, as it's sprinkled on top of a bowl of
dialog: oatmeal.
speaker_heading: MOM (OS)
dialog: Happy! Come in here. Thomas Wayne
text: is on TV.
text: Joker takes a couple of pills for himself. Looks inside. Not
text: many left. He looks over at the orange cat sitting on the
text: counter, purring loudly, watching him.
speaker_heading: MOM (OS)
dialog: Quick! Come.
scene_heading: 45 INT. MOM'S BEDROOM, APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 45
text: Joker walks in carrying her breakfast. She waves him over to
dialog: her bed.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: They're interviewing him about
dialog: those horrible murders on the
dialog: subway last week.
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Why are they talking to him?
text: His mother shushes him. Joker sits on the end of the bed next
dialog: to her. It's one of those "Good Morning, Gotham" shows.
speaker_heading: THOMAS WAYNE (ON TV)
dialog: --as you know, Jerry, all three of
dialog: them worked at Wayne Investments,
dialog: and they were the best of the best.
text: Solid young men.
text: A small smirk registers on Joker's face when photos of the
text: THREE WALL STREET GUYS come up on the screen.
speaker_heading: THOMAS WAYNE (ON TV)
dialog: And while I didn't know them
dialog: personally, like all Wayne
dialog: employees, past and present, they
dialog: were family.
dialog: Joker's mom perks up at that--
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: You hear that! I told you. We're
dialog: family.
text: ANGLE ON TELEVISION, footage of GRAFFITI around the city.
text: "KILL THE RICH" spray painted on a storefront. "F CK WALL
text: STREET" written on a subway wall. "RESIST" scrawled across a
dialog: billboard.
scene_heading: "GOOD MORNING" HOST (ON TV)
text: There now seems to be a groundswell
text: of anti-rich sentiment in the city.
dialog: It's almost as if our less
dialog: fortunate residents have taken the
dialog: side of the killer.
speaker_heading: THOMAS WAYNE (ON TV)
dialog: Yes and it's a shame. It's one of
dialog: the reasons I'm considering a run
text: for mayor. Gotham has lost its way.
scene_heading: "GOOD MORNING" HOST (ON TV)
dialog: Are you announcing your candidacy?
speaker_heading: THOMAS WAYNE (ON TV)
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: No comment.
text: We hear his mother gasp, excited.
dialog: 42.
scene_heading: "GOOD MORNING" HOST (ON TV)
dialog: What about the eyewitness report of
dialog: the suspect being a man in clown
dialog: make-up or a clown mask-- Care to
dialog: comment on that?
text: Joker leans in, intrigued. The camera zooms in closer to
text: Thomas Wayne on the screen...
speaker_heading: THOMAS WAYNE (ON TV)
dialog: It makes total sense to me. What
dialog: kind of coward would do something
dialog: that cold-blooded? Someone who
text: hides behind a mask. Someone who's
dialog: envious of those more fortunate
dialog: than themselves, yet too scared to
dialog: show their own face.
dialog: (to camera)
dialog: And until that jealousy ends, those
dialog: of us who've made a good life for
dialog: ourselves will always look at those
dialog: who haven't as nothing but clowns.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 46 INT. COMEDY CLUB, BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - NIGHT 46
text: JOKER'S POV, slowly walking down the hall -- as if in slow
text: motion -- toward a curtain at the end, spotlight bleeding
text: through, other wannabe comics looking at him as he passes--
text: CLOSE ON JOKER, eyeing the others, sweat beading on his
dialog: forehead--
text: He gets to the curtain, the light, pulls his worn joke-
text: notebook out of his back pocket. Glancing into the room he
text: sees it's a pretty good crowd. Sees Sophie taking a seat in
dialog: the back.
text: Wheeling back into the dark hallway, he catches his breath in
dialog: the shadows--
text: And starts BANGING HIS HEAD BACK against the wall--
text: He hears the EMCEE from the stage.
speaker_heading: EMCEE (OS)
dialog: This next comic describes himself
dialog: as a lifelong Gotham resident who
dialog: from a young age was always told
dialog: that "his purpose in life was to
dialog: bring joy and laughter into this
dialog: cold, dark world." Ummm. Okay.
dialog: 43.
text: He hears the crowd laugh.
speaker_heading: EMCEE (OS)
dialog: Please help me welcome Arthur
dialog: Fleck!
text: There is a smattering of applause.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: JOKER STEPPING ON STAGE, out under the spotlight, lifts the
text: microphone in front of his mouth, the light so bright he
text: can't see faces in the dark audience, his hand trembling
text: holding onto his worn notebook--
text: He takes a deep breath, looks out at the dark crowd, and
text: opens his mouth.
text: And starts to laugh. His eyes go wide. God no, not now. A
text: terrified look comes to his face under the laughter. He just
text: keeps laughing. The crowd is just staring back at him.
dialog: Finally he composes himself--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (trying to stop himself
dialog: from laughing)
dialog: -- good evening, hello.
dialog: (deep breath; trying to
dialog: stop laughing)
dialog: Good to be here.
dialog: (keeps cracking up)
dialog: I, I hated school as a kid. But my
dialog: mother would always say,--
dialog: (bad imitation of his mom,
dialog: still laughing)
dialog: "You should enjoy it. One day
dialog: you'll have to work for a living."
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: "No I won't, Ma. I'm gonna be a
dialog: comedian!"
text: Dead silence. Except for Joker, who's still cracking up.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 47 EXT. COMEDY CLUB, CHINATOWN STREET - NIGHT 47
text: Joker and Sophie walking out of the club after the show, the
text: audience trickles out around them. Nobody looking in Joker's
text: direction, nobody says anything to him, maybe one or two even
text: cracking up at him behind his back. Garbage bags crowding the
text: narrow street, lit up by the bright signs.
dialog: 44.
text: Joker and Sophie walk a ways without saying a word. Awkward
dialog: silence.
dialog: Then--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: So, did you laugh? Really couldn't
dialog: see much from up there.
text: Sophie pauses, doesn't know what to say. She lights up a
dialog: cigarette.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: (trying to be nice)
dialog: Of course. Yeah. You couldn't hear
dialog: anything?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: All I heard was my heart pounding.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: It was good. I really needed to get
dialog: out of my apartment so, thanks.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What happened to the rest of your
dialog: friends?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: What friends?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Didn't you say some of your friends
dialog: were coming?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (he forgot; recovers)
dialog: Yeah, I decided not to invite them.
dialog: As a performer sometimes you want
text: to see how a "real" crowd reacts.
dialog: People who don't already love me,
dialog: or, or have a notion of who I am,
dialog: you know?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Yeah. I get that.
text: Joker smiles at the connection. They walk past a newsstand--
text: a wall of Chinese language newspapers mixed with local papers
text: and tabloids, screaming headlines about the three Wall Street
text: Guys gunned down on the train.
text: Joker stops and stares at the headlines--
dialog: 45.
text: CLOSE ON HEADLINES, "Subway Vigilante"... "Yuppie Slaughter"
dialog: "Killer Clown On The Loose?"...
speaker_heading: SOPHIE (OS)
dialog: (re: the headlines)
dialog: You believe that shit?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Yeah,-- I don't know how something
dialog: like that happens.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Please. I'll bet you five bucks
dialog: those rich assholes deserved it.
text: He turns to her.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: You think?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Look at their faces. Those smug
dialog: smiles. I've seen that look. Fuck
dialog: them.
text: Sophie flicks her cigarette away and starts walking.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: The guy who did it is a hero. Three
dialog: less pricks in Gotham City. Woo-
dialog: hoo! Only a million more to go.
text: Joker watches her walk for a beat.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (calls out to her)
dialog: Hey. You want to get some coffee?
text: Sophie turns around and smiles. She looks great, even in
text: front of the mounds of garbage bags that line the sidewalk.
text: AN AMBULANCE SCREAMS BY, SIRENS BLARING as Sophie says
text: something that Joker doesn't hear. She keeps walking.
text: Joker chases after her and trips over a TIN GARBAGE CAN LID--
text: CLANG. CLANG. He falls down flat on his face.
text: Sophie turns and bursts out laughing. She can't help but
text: laugh. It's the first time she's laughed all night.
dialog: 46.
scene_heading: 48 INT. SZECHUAN ACE RESTAURANT, TABLE - NIGHT 48
text: Table covered with plates of half-eaten Chinese food.
text: Joker and Sophie sitting across from each other, middle of
text: conversation. Crowded room, brightly lit, looks more like a
text: casino. Almost everybody eating there is Chinese. It's loud.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: --I'm telling you, it's across the
dialog: board. Wall Street, the banks,
dialog: politicians. They've been making a
dialog: killing for years. Fuck them.
text: Joker takes a moment to think about what she said.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: What don't you know?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Not all of them are awful. Take
dialog: someone like Thomas Wayne for
dialog: example. He's a hero.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Oh c'mon, he's the worst!
dialog: Joker is taken aback--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Sophie, he's the only one who can
dialog: save this city.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: You can't be serious!? He's a
dialog: complete narcissist. Brags about
text: his money. Meanwhile, the rest of
dialog: us can barely make rent. Or feed
dialog: our kids.
text: Joker nods. Thinking about it.
dialog: Then--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: With what?
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: With your job. At the bank?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: (suddenly uncomfortable)
dialog: Oh. Yeah, I was, um,--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: We don't have to talk about it.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Have you ever been fired before?
text: Joker thinks it over for a moment.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Every time.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: And have you ever wanted to torch
dialog: the place?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (thinks it over again)
dialog: Every time.
text: Sophie smiles.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Right. And this was like the first
dialog: good job I had in like, years. Not
dialog: waitressing or anything like that.
dialog: It was 9-5. I had benefits. You
dialog: know what that means when you have
dialog: a kid?
text: Joker just looks at her, he doesn't really know what that
text: means. He just smiles.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: But from the very first day, the
text: manager guy starts smiling at me,
text: whispering in my ear, touching me,
dialog: trying to get me to sleep with him--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Did you do it? Did you go to bed
dialog: with him?
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Fuck no. The guy's a fucking pig.
dialog: So finally I complained to his
dialog: boss, and they fired me... And now,
dialog: now I don't know what to do with
dialog: myself.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Right. Wait, what do you mean?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I finally felt good. Like I had a
dialog: future. A purpose. And now I don't
dialog: even know how I'm gonna pay my
dialog: rent.
text: AND JOKER STARTS LAUGHING. He puts a hand over his mouth
text: trying to cover it, but he can't stop cracking up--
text: It's unsettling and disturbing for Sophie. People eating,
text: waiters in red vests, busboys, all look over and stare at
text: him. A few laugh. Joker turns away embarrassed, he looks out
text: the plate-glass window, face turning red from laughing so
dialog: hard--
text: AS HE LOOKS OUT, HE SEES A GROUP OF ROWDY KIDS walking down
text: the street. One of them glances back before he turns the
text: corner-- HE'S WEARING A CLOWN MASK THAT LOOKS JUST JOKER'S
text: CLOWN FACE. And then he's gone. The group disappears around
dialog: the corner--
text: Joker can't believe his eyes, still laughing-- He turns to
text: Sophie who didn't see them. Just sits there awkwardly waiting
dialog: for it to stop.
text: Finally, it subsides--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (catching his breath)
dialog: I'm sorry. I have this thing--
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I know.
text: Awkward beat.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: How did you get it?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I don't know. I read you can get it
dialog: from a brain injury or, or a lesion
dialog: in there. My mom said I was born
dialog: this way. Born laughing.
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Is that why she calls you Happy?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Kind of. That actually started when
dialog: I was a kid. The other kids made
dialog: fun of me, called me Happy-- but
dialog: not in a good way. I got so sick of
dialog: it, one day when I was about ten,
dialog: I, I,--
text: He smiles.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I took a razor and cut this smile
dialog: onto my face.
text: (she's taken aback as he
dialog: points to the scars)
dialog: Sort of like "You want happy? Here,
dialog: how's this for happy?"
text: He looks down, still smiling. She just watches him for a
dialog: beat.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I've been thinking about this night
dialog: my whole life.
text: They just sit there for a beat. Quiet.
scene_heading: 49 INT. MOM'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 49
text: Joker opening the door to his mother's apartment, holding a
text: doggie bag in his hand, sees the flickering blue light of the
text: TV on in the living room, hears the end of "LIVE WITH MURRAY
text: FRANKLIN!" He locks the locks, drawing the security chain
text: high on the door.
text: TURNS TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF HIS MOTHER PASSED OUT in the
text: living room, the cat jumping up next to her on the chair.
text: Joker watches for a beat as Murray does his signature sign
dialog: off, the one he's been doing for years--
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN (ON TV)
dialog: (looking into camera)
dialog: Good night! And always remember,--
dialog: That's life.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: "That's life."
text: He hears Don Ellis and his Jazz Orchestra playing the show's
text: closing song-- the instrumental version of Frank Sinatra's
dialog: "That's Life".
text: As the music continues, Joker puts his face up against his
text: mom's nose, to see if she's breathing or if she's dead.
text: He feels her breath against his cheek.
text: Now he picks his mother up in his arms and carries her into
text: her bedroom to the music, almost as if he's dancing with her
text: as he leaves the room...
dialog: We stay behind.
text: "That's Life" still playing from TV.
text: He comes back into the living room and turns off the TV.
text: Takes off his jacket and throws it on the couch. Notices
text: something sticking out of his jacket pocket. He pulls it out.
dialog: It's the envelope he was supposed to deliver to Thomas Wayne.
text: He stares at it for a beat. And then--
text: Quietly rips it open, starts to read the letter:
dialog: CLOSE ON WORDS, "Dearest Thomas, I don't know where else to
dialog: turn..."

text: THE ORANGE CAT SITS AT HIS FEET staring up at him, won't take

speaker_heading: JOKER

speaker_heading: MOM

dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: MOM (OS)
dialog: He is an extraordinary man, Arthur.
dialog: We had a connection. I was so

speaker_heading: MOM (OS)

speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (eyes still closed, head

speaker_heading: RANDALL

text: Joker looks hard at Randall for a moment, just slowly nods,

dialog: at him--
speaker_heading: HA-HA CLOWN #1 (OS)
dialog: Did you really bring a gun to the
dialog: kid's hospital, Artie? What the

speaker_heading: HA-HA CLOWN #2
dialog: No, I heard he pulled it out and
text: waved it around like a cowboy.
text: His co-workers crack up. Joker answers the guy without
dialog: looking back--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: It was a prop gun. And I didn't
text: pull it out, it fell out.
speaker_heading: MAGICIAN
dialog: So is that part of your new act? If

speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Art! Hold up,--

dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: Why would you say that? That, that

speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: ...
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: You don't get it, do you, buddy,
dialog: that shit that went down on the

speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Randall, I didn't shoot anybody.

speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: You know they're sellin' masks.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (turning back around)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: They're selling masks of your clown
dialog: face,-- based off the description I
dialog: guess. It's like a thing now.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: There's a lot of people in this

dialog: did. If you did it.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Randall. Your nose.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: What?

text: like Thomas Wayne's hair. Maybe there is a resemblance.
text: WIDER ANGLE, train is packed with wealthy white businessmen
text: and a couple businesswomen heading home after work, many of

scene_heading: 56 EXT. WAYNE MANOR, FRONT LAWN - MAGIC HOUR 56
text: Joker walking along an intimidating wrought iron fence,
text: surrounding the estate like prison bars, the brown paper
text: shopping bag stuffed under his arm. The big house set up a
text: small hill, evergreens dot the lush grounds. As he walks
text: around looking for the front entrance, Joker catches a
text: glimpse of an innocent looking EIGHT-YEAR-OLD BOY tracking
text: him from behind the trees, hiding as he follows.
text: Joker stops.
text: He sees the boy stop behind a tree.
text: Joker continues walking until he gets to the front gate. He
text: digs into his bag and pulls out the magic wand--
text: He holds it up for the boy to see.
text: The boy steps out from behind a tree to get a closer look.
text: Joker puts the brown bag down on the ground, looks over the
text: wand, pretending like he's trying to figure out what it does.
text: He waves the wand over the front gate lock to "try and see"
dialog: if it will open-- It doesn't.
dialog: 58.
text: The little boy walks down toward the fence, face like an
dialog: angel.
text: Joker waits until he gets closer and then reaches his hand
text: through the fence and hands the kid his magic wand so he can
dialog: try and figure out what it does--
text: The boy takes the wand and it goes limp in his hand before he
text: can wave it-- He laughs, surprised. He hands it back to
dialog: Joker.
text: The boys sees Joker's face up close, staring at his scarred
dialog: smile--
text: Joker straightens the wand back out, and reaches in through
text: the fence again so the kid can give it another try.
text: AND AGAIN THE MAGIC WAND DROOPS IN THE BOY'S HAND. He laughs
dialog: and gives it back to Joker--
text: Joker examines the wand as if its "broken", stiffens it one
text: last time, crouches down lower, and...
text: Ta-da! A bouquet of flowers bursts out the end of the wand--
text: Joker smiles and hands him the wand bouquet of flowers--
text: The little boy takes the flowers. Keeps staring at Joker, at
text: the scars around his mouth.
text: Now, he reaches his hand out through the fence and touches
text: Joker's face, tracing his finger around the edges of Joker's
text: mouth, over his scarred smile--
text: Joker closes his eyes -- embarrassed -- but it feels good to
dialog: him, nobody ever touches him besides his mother.
text: He starts to smile, when a man's voice shatters the moment--
speaker_heading: ALFRED (OS)

dialog: accent)
dialog: Bruce! What are you doing? Get away

text: Joker stands back up.
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: ALFRED

dialog: My name's Arthur. I'm here to see
dialog: Mr. Wayne--
speaker_heading: ALFRED

text: Alfred takes the flower-wand away from the kid--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I, I was just trying to make him
dialog: laugh.
text: He hands it back to Joker.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Well it's not funny. Do I need to
dialog: call the police?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: No, please. My mother's name is
dialog: Penny Fleck. She used to work here,
dialog: years ago. Can you tell Mr. Wayne
dialog: that I need to see him?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: (color drains from his
dialog: face; beat)
dialog: You're her son?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Did you know her?
text: Alfred doesn't say anything.
text: Joker puts his face right up against the bars, whispers so
dialog: the boy can't hear him--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: You don't need to cover for them.
dialog: I'm sure Mrs. Wayne was very upset
dialog: when she found out.
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: There was nothing to find out
dialog: about. Your mother was, was
text: delusional. She was a sick woman.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: No. No, just let me speak to Mr.

text: Now Alfred leans in closer to Joker, almost looks like he

speaker_heading: ALFRED

dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (blurts out)
dialog: Thomas Wayne is my father--

dialog: flowers in one hand--
text: AS HE CHOKES ALFRED, Joker sees little Bruce, wide-eyed in

scene_heading: 58 EXT. STREET, APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 58

scene_heading: DET. GARRITY

scene_heading: DET. GARRITY
dialog: You weren't fired?

speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Not for having a gun. That was prop

scene_heading: DET. BURKE

speaker_heading: JOKER

speaker_heading: JOKER

speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Okay. Thanks.

speaker_heading: ER RESIDENT
dialog: One of them's perphenazine. It's a
dialog: powerful anti-psychotic. If she was

dialog: from laughing)
dialog: -- good evening, hello.
dialog: (deep breath; trying to
dialog: stop laughing)
dialog: Good to be here.
dialog: (keeps cracking up)
dialog: I, I hated school as a kid. But my
dialog: mother would always say,--
dialog: (bad imitation of his mom,
dialog: still laughing)
dialog: "You should enjoy it. One day
dialog: you'll have to work for a living."
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: "No I won't, Ma. I'm gonna be a

text: Back to Murray Franklin shaking his head, trying not to
dialog: laugh.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN (ON TV)
dialog: You should have listened to your
dialog: mother.
text: The studio audience erupts into laughter.
text: ANGLE ON JOKER, watching Murray Franklin make fun of him on
text: TV. He gets up and starts walking toward the TV set as if in
text: a trance. Unsure if this is really happening.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN (ON TV)
dialog: One more, Bernie. Let's see one
dialog: more. I love this guy.
text: The tape continues of Joker at the comedy club.
speaker_heading: JOKER (ON TV)
dialog: It's funny, when I was a little boy
dialog: and told people I wanted to be a
dialog: comedian, everyone laughed at me.
text: (opens his arms like a big
dialog: shot)
text: Well no one is laughing now.
text: Dead silence. Nobody is laughing. Not even him.
text: CUT BACK CLOSE ON MURRAY FRANKLIN, just shaking his head.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN (ON TV)
dialog: You can say that again, pal!
text: Murray cracks up and the studio audience laughs along with
dialog: him.
text: CLOSE ON JOKER, looking up at the television, hearing them
text: all laughing at him.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JUMP CUT:
text: Joker is dragging a chair to the television set.
text: In a rage, he gets up on the chair and tries to pull the TV
text: out of the wall, as the show continues to play--
text: But the set is firmly secured to the wall, and Joker pulls so
text: hard the chair flips from underneath him and he goes flying
text: up the air, crashing down hard onto the floor.
scene_heading: 64 INT. CAFETERIA, CITY HOSPITAL - EARLY MORNING 64
text: Joker walks with a plastic tray of food. Some runny eggs and
text: a coffee. He keeps his head down so no one can see his face.
text: There are a few DOCTORS AND NURSES sitting and chatting at
text: one table. A group of ORDERLIES are sitting together at
dialog: another table.
text: He goes and sits down in the far corner, far away from
text: everyone else. Sees a tabloid newspaper left on the table,
text: and picks it up to read so he doesn't seem so alone.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON FRONT PAGE HEADLINE, "Thomas Wayne Announces Run",
text: over a full-page campaign-style photograph of Thomas Wayne
text: waving to a crowd standing next to his wife, MARTHA (50's), a
text: severe looking, well-preserved former model, and little Bruce
text: Wayne standing in front of them. Photo catches Bruce looking
text: into camera, eyes wide, scared by the crowd.
scene_heading: SUB-HEADLINE READS, "Protest Planned at Wayne Hall Opening
dialog: Tonight"
text: Joker stares at the family photo.
text: CLOSE ON BRUCE WAYNE IN PHOTO, Joker's fingers ripping his
text: picture out of the front page.
speaker_heading: YOUNG DOCTOR (OS)
dialog: -- I'm sorry to bother you, but can
dialog: you settle an argument for us?
dialog: 69.
text: CLOSE ON JOKER LOOKING UP, interrupted from ripping out the
text: picture. One YOUNG DOCTOR and TWO NURSES are standing around
text: him. We stay with Joker, don't see their faces. Just their
text: bodies, all dressed in green scrubs, uniforms.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: YOUNG DOCTOR (OS)
dialog: You were the guy on Murray Franklin
dialog: last night, right?
text: He hears the nurses giggle.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: No, sorry. Wasn't me.
speaker_heading: NURSE #1 (OS)
dialog: Of course it was you. You were the
dialog: comedian.
speaker_heading: YOUNG DOCTOR (OS)
dialog: Except you weren't funny. You
dialog: didn't tell any jokes.
text: He hears the nurses giggle again.
text: STAY CLOSE ON JOKER, getting upset. He just shakes his head.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I don't know what you're talking
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: YOUNG DOCTOR (OS)
dialog: No. It was definitely you, buddy.
dialog: You're the guy who couldn't stop
dialog: laughing. Murray killed you.
text: More laughter. Joker looks up at them.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: If I were you, I'd walk away from
dialog: this table before I strangle all
dialog: three of you with that fucking
dialog: stethoscope hanging from your neck.
dialog: Beat.
scene_heading: 65 EXT. CENTER FOR PERFORMING ARTS, WAYNE HALL - UPTOWN - DUSK
dialog: 65
text: Joker crosses a busy street heading to the Center for
text: Performing Arts. Light falling. Storm clouds gathering.
dialog: 70.
text: Joker stops when he sees--
text: A CROWD OF PROTESTERS SCREAMING AND SHOUTING IN FRONT OF
text: WAYNE HALL, behind steel barricades. Many wearing Joker's
text: "clown face" mask... A few wave homemade signs, "CLOWN FOR
text: MAYOR"... "KILL THE RICH"... "MR. WAYNE, AM I A CLOWN?"
text: A LINE OF POLICEMEN AND SECURITY GUARDS stand between the
text: crowd and the lit-up white marble building.
text: Joker watches the protest for a moment, then continues across
text: the street. It starts to rain.
scene_heading: 66 EXT. WAYNE HALL, FRONT ENTRANCE - EVENING 66
text: A FIGHT BREAKS OUT between a "clown" masked protester and two
text: cops. The crowd goes crazy, pushing through the barricades
text: toward the building in the driving rain. The police and Wayne
dialog: Hall Security fight to keep them out--
text: Amidst all the chaos, we glimpse Joker slipping into the
dialog: building unnoticed--
scene_heading: 67 INT. LOBBY, WAYNE HALL - EVENING 67
text: Joker walks through the massive multi-level lobby. It's
text: completely empty since the performance has already begun and
text: whatever security was available is outside helping the police
dialog: deal with the protesters.
text: He looks up in awe at the crystal chandeliers... The shiny,
text: marble floor beneath his feet. He's never seen anything this
text: opulent in his entire life.
scene_heading: 68 INT. BACK OF THEATER, WAYNE HALL - EVENING 68
text: JOKER MAKING HIS WAY THROUGH THE DARK SHADOWS ALONG THE BACK
text: WALL OF THE AUDITORIUM, looking for Thomas Wayne in the sold-
dialog: out black-tie audience--
text: He catches bits of Chaplin's MODERN TIMES projected on a
text: screen behind the Gotham Philharmonic playing the silent
text: movie's score... the Tramp roller skating blindfolded on a
text: date with the Gamin (Paulette Goddard) in a department store.
text: He continues moving along the wall from aisle-to-aisle
dialog: looking for Thomas Wayne...
text: The audience laughs as the Tramp skates blindfolded, skirting
text: along the edge of a balcony with no rail, orchestra playing
text: the bouncy score. Joker can't find Thomas Wayne in the dark--
dialog: 71.
text: He moves to the top of the next aisle, pausing to watch more
text: of the film. Suddenly somebody bumps into Joker--
text: He looks up and sees it's one of Thomas Wayne's TWO SECURITY
text: GUARDS, escorting Thomas Wayne out of the auditorium--
text: Joker turns and watches them lead him out. Behind Joker on
text: screen, the Tramp is rescued by the girl before he falls off
dialog: the edge, orchestra swelling--
scene_heading: 69 INT. LOBBY, WAYNE HALL - CONTINUOUS 69
text: Joker peeks his head out of the auditorium, sees Thomas Wayne
text: heading into the men's room, his two security guards waiting
text: by the door, still hear the orchestra playing the score--
text: Joker glances back into the auditorium--
text: Sees a lobby broom and upright dustpan tucked in the back
dialog: corner--
scene_heading: 70 INT. HALLWAY, MEN'S ROOM - WAYNE HALL - SECONDS LATER 70
text: Joker's sweeping up the hallway with his head down, hear the
text: orchestra playing the melancholy "Smile" from the film's
text: score. He sweeps along to the music like Emmett Kelly's
text: famous hobo clown... Sweeping around the two security guards'
text: feet... Annoyed, they move a bit away from the bathroom
text: door... And don't give Joker a second look as he heads
dialog: inside...
scene_heading: 71 INT. MEN'S ROOM, WAYNE HALL - CONTINUOUS 71
text: Joker sweeps his way into the cavernous, black &amp; white tiled
text: bathroom, ornate gold fixtures. It's empty save for Thomas
text: Wayne peeing at the far end of a long line of urinals.
text: Joker takes a deep breath, and walks down the line of urinals
dialog: right up next to Thomas Wayne--
text: He stands there for a beat while Thomas urinates, lobby broom
dialog: and upright dustpan in hand--
speaker_heading: THOMAS WAYNE
dialog: (glances over; annoyed)
dialog: Can I help you, pal?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: What? Yeah. No I, I--
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: THOMAS WAYNE
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: You need to get in here or
dialog: something?
text: Thomas Wayne finishes and zips his fly back up. Joker is not
dialog: sure what to say to him, just says--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Dad. It's me.
dialog: Beat.
text: But Thomas Wayne doesn't hear him, he was flushing the
text: urinal. He walks toward the sink.
speaker_heading: THOMAS WAYNE
dialog: Excuse me?
text: Joker follows after him.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: My name is Arthur. I'm Penny's son.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I know you didn't know about me,
dialog: and I don't want anything from you.
dialog: Well... maybe a hug.
text: And Joker smiles, it's all very emotional for him. Thomas
text: looks over at him like he's fucking crazy.
speaker_heading: THOMAS WAYNE
dialog: Jesus? You're the guy who came by
dialog: my house yesterday.
text: Joker nods, relieved he finally broke through.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Yes. But they wouldn't let me in,
dialog: wouldn't let me see you. So I came
dialog: here. I have so many questions.
text: Thomas Wayne just laughs to himself and turns on the gold
text: faucets at one of the sinks.
speaker_heading: THOMAS WAYNE
dialog: Look pal, I'm not your father.
dialog: What's wrong with you?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: How do you know?
text: Thomas Wayne just keeps washing his hands, doesn't even look
text: over at Joker.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: THOMAS WAYNE
dialog: Cause you were adopted. And I never
dialog: fucked your mother. What do you
dialog: want from me, money?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: No. What? I wasn't adopted.
text: Thomas starts drying his hands.
speaker_heading: THOMAS WAYNE
dialog: She never told you? Your mother
dialog: adopted you before she even started
dialog: working for us. She was arrested
dialog: when you were four years old and
dialog: committed to Arkham State Hospital.
dialog: She's batshit crazy.
text: Joker starts to smile, feels a laugh coming on.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: No. No, I don't believe that.
text: Thomas finishes drying his hands. Turns to Joker, his tone
dialog: way more serious now.
speaker_heading: THOMAS WAYNE
dialog: I don't really give a shit what you
dialog: believe.
dialog: (steps in closer)
dialog: But if you ever come to my house
dialog: again, if you ever talk to my son
dialog: again, if I ever even hear about
dialog: you again, I'll--
text: AND JOKER CRACKS UP LAUGHING, interrupting his threat.
text: Laughing right in his face--
speaker_heading: THOMAS WAYNE
dialog: Are you laughing at me?
text: Joker's laughing so hard he can't answer.
text: THOMAS SHOVES JOKER HARD UP AGAINST THE TILED WALL, gripping
text: his neck with one hand. Joker just cracks up louder, he drops
dialog: the dustpan and broom--
speaker_heading: THOMAS WAYNE
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: You think this is funny?
text: Thomas Wayne's security guards bang open the door, rushing
text: into the bathroom when they hear the shouting--
dialog: 74.
text: They stop when they see Thomas has Joker jacked up against
dialog: the wall.
speaker_heading: JOKER
text: (tries shaking his head
dialog: no; still laughing and
dialog: choking)
dialog: No, no I have a con--
speaker_heading: THOMAS WAYNE
dialog: (interrupting; raising his
dialog: voice)
dialog: Is this a fucking joke to you?
text: AND THOMAS WAYNE PUNCHES JOKER STRAIGHT IN THE FACE with his
text: free hand, blood spraying from his nose--
scene_heading: 72 EXT. WAYNE HALL, FRONT ENTRANCE - PLAZA - NIGHT 72
text: The two security guards roughly throw Joker out of the hall,
text: right in front of the drenched crowd of screaming protesters,
text: TV cameras and photographers now on hand, bulbs flashing--
text: Joker knowing how to take a fall, plays it up in front of
dialog: this audience for all it's worth, tumbling end-over-end out
text: onto the plaza in the rain--
text: He rolls to his feet with a bit of panache and brushes
text: himself off like it was nothing.
text: The protesters go crazy, cheering and applauding his act--
text: And Joker takes a deep dramatic bow. Wet hair. Bloody nose.
text: He turns and sees the security guards coming back out--
text: Joker takes off running through the plaza in the downpour,
text: running out of the Center for Performing Arts. Turns down a
dialog: side street almost slipping--
text: And keeps running even though nobody's chasing after him.
text: We HEAR the familiar beats of THE SUGARHILL GANG'S "Apache"
text: as Joker just keeps running and running.
scene_heading: 73 INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY - NIGHT 73
text: Joker knocking on Sophie's apartment door, "Apache" blaring
text: inside. He's soaking wet, clothes clinging to his body.
text: There's no answer.
dialog: 75.
text: He knocks again. Hard to hear anything over the loud music.
text: Now he tries the door. It's unlocked.
scene_heading: 74 INT. SOPHIE'S APARTMENT, FRONT HALL - CONTINUOUS 74
text: Joker walks into Sophie's apartment, "Apache" thumping,
text: lights dim.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Sophie?
text: WALKS INTO THE DARK LIVING ROOM, catches a glimpse of Sophie,
text: naked riding on top of SOME GUY on the couch--
text: The guy sees Joker standing in the shadows and jumps. Sophie
text: turns and sees Joker as well. She screams--
scene_heading: 75 INT. HALLWAY, APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 75
text: Joker rushing for his mother's apartment.
text: Behind him, the guy comes out half naked into the hallway,
text: zipping up his pants, screaming at Joker--
text: Joker doesn't look back, doesn't hear the guy yelling at him--
text: Quickly opens the door to his mother's apartment and hurries
dialog: inside.
scene_heading: 76 EXT. ARKHAM STATE HOSPITAL - MORNING 76
text: A GRAY, BEHEMOTH STATE HOSPITAL looming over the city block.
text: Metal screens cover steel-framed windows. Joker crosses the
text: street toward the building, eyes weary, he hasn't slept in
dialog: days.
text: HE SEES TWO GOTHAM CITY COPS AND A PARAMEDIC rolling a gurney
text: into the entrance... a naked, sunburned man screaming his
text: head off is handcuffed to the stretcher underneath a white
text: sheet. Joker follows them inside.
scene_heading: 77 INT. ARKHAM STATE HOSPITAL - ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE - MORNING
dialog: 77
text: Joker sits waiting in a cramped office, looking out a
text: plexiglass window that overlooks the crowded hallway--
dialog: 76.
text: A constant din of people moving about, talking and shouting.
text: Patients handcuffed to the armrests of their wheelchairs,
text: lying on stretchers, heads covered with pillowcase turbans or
text: forearms to block out the harsh fluorescent lights.
text: His gaze is interrupted by a CLERK (40's), ID clipped to his
text: shirt, who's lugging an old heavy file storage box.
text: He drops the box down on his messy desk with a thud.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Sorry for the wait. All our records
dialog: that are 10 years or older are
dialog: stored in the basement. You're
dialog: talking over 30 years ago,-- I had
dialog: to do some serious digging.
text: Joker nods thanks.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Like I said, if it's in here, I'm
dialog: still gonna need a release from
dialog: her.
text: The clerk opens the file box. Starts digging though it. Joker
text: stares out the plexiglass window that faces the hallway--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Can I ask you a question? How does
dialog: someone wind up in here? Have all
dialog: these people committed crimes?
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (going through the files)
dialog: Some have. Some are just crazy and
dialog: pose a danger to themselves or
dialog: others. Some just got nowhere else
dialog: to go.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (nods; looks down)
dialog: Yeah, I know how that is. Sometimes
dialog: I don't know what to do, y'know, I
dialog: don't think I can take any more of
dialog: this.
text: The clerk is half listening as he scans the paper work.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Yeah, I can't take much more of
dialog: this shit either.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: CLERK (CONT'D)
dialog: Now they talking about more
dialog: layoffs, man, we're understaffed as
dialog: it is. I don't know what I'm gonna
dialog: do.
text: Joker looks up at the guy, thinking he's made a connection.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Last time I ended up taking it out
dialog: on some,-- people. Bad shit. I
dialog: thought it would bother me but, it
dialog: really hasn't.
text: For the first time, the clerk looks at him--
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: It's just so hard to try and be
dialog: happy all the time, y'know, when
dialog: everything's going to shit all
dialog: around you.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (taken aback; beat)
dialog: Listen, I'm just an administrative
dialog: assistant, like a clerk. I file
dialog: paperwork, fill out forms. I don't
dialog: really know what to tell you, but
dialog: maybe you should see someone-- they
dialog: have programs, like city services.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (backtracking)
dialog: Yeah. They cut those. Anyway, I was
dialog: just talking to talk.
text: The clerk just nods. Finally finds what he was looking for.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Here it is,-- Fleck. Penny Fleck.
text: He pulls out an old file, bulging with yellowing records.
text: Moves the box to the floor and sits down at his desk.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (saying it out loud for
dialog: himself to hear)
dialog: So she was a patient here.
text: The guy opens the file. Yellowing pages of her records--
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (nods, skim-reading)
text: Uh-huh. Diagnosed by Dr. Benjamin
dialog: Stoner... The patient suffers from
dialog: delusional psychosis and
dialog: narcissistic personality
dialog: disorder... Found guilty of
dialog: endangering the welfare of a child--
text: The clerk stops reading out loud, eyes going wide as he skims
text: further ahead. Joker just looks at the guy, waiting to see
dialog: what he's gonna say.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: You said she's your mother?
text: Joker just nods.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (closes the file)
dialog: I'm sorry, I can't. Like I said, I
dialog: can't release this without the
dialog: proper forms. I could get in
dialog: trouble.
dialog: (closes the file; beat)
dialog: Besides, it's pretty bad.
text: CLOSE ON JOKER, he shakes his head and smiles to himself.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I can handle bad. I've been on a
dialog: pretty bad run myself.
text: The clerk puts the file down on his desk--
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: I can't help you. If you want these
dialog: records you have to get your mom to
dialog: sign a patient disclosure form. I
dialog: can have someone mail you one.
text: Joker just sits there, thinking it all over for a moment.
text: Then snatches the file off the clerk's desk--
text: The clerk grabs it as well.
text: They play tug-of-war with the file, it's awkward and goes on
text: way too long. Finally, Joker shoves the guy hard and pulls
dialog: the file away--
dialog: 79.
text: He takes off running out of the office with it. The clerk
text: watches for a beat, but does nothing.
scene_heading: 78 INT. HALLWAY, ARKHAM STATE HOSPITAL - MORNING 78
text: Joker running down the hallway, files in his hands. Frantic.
text: Unaware he is not being chased.
text: Turns a corner and runs down another long hallway.
text: Gets to a stairwell door and runs in.
scene_heading: 79 INT. STAIRWELL, ARKHAM STATE HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS 79
text: Bounding down the steps. He stops at a landing below. Looks
text: up, sees no one is chasing after him--
text: ANGLE ON JOKER, catching his breath. He opens the file,
text: flipping through the records, finds the page the clerk was
text: reading. As he reads it over for himself, he HEARS his mother
dialog: being interviewed for her psychiatric assessment, over 30
dialog: years ago.
speaker_heading: MOM (VO)
dialog: He's not adopted-- he's Thomas
dialog: Wayne's son. I work for him, I told

speaker_heading: (FLASHBACK)
text: Penny Fleck (late 20's) is sitting across the table from DR.
text: BENJAMIN STONER (50's), in a dreary small interview room,
text: windows covered with security screens. Penny takes a drag off
text: a cigarette, her face is beaten to shit, nose battered, lip
text: busted up.
text: Dr. Stoner is going over Penny's thick file, the same file
text: Joker's holding in his hands.
speaker_heading: DR. STONER
dialog: We went over this, Penny. You
dialog: adopted him. We have all the
dialog: paperwork right here.
text: Penny doesn't say anything, just smiles like she's in on a
text: big secret. And exhales smoke.
dialog: 80.
text: Dr. Stoner keeps going through the file, pulls out black &amp;
text: white forensic photographs of three-year-old Joker's body--
speaker_heading: DR. STONER
dialog: You also stood by as one of your
dialog: boyfriends repeatedly abused your
dialog: adopted son. And battered you.
text: Penny looks at Dr. Stoner like he's crazy.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: He didn't do anything to me. Or to
dialog: my boy. Can I go now, I don't like
dialog: hospitals.
text: Dr. Stoner lays out the photographs in front of Penny--
text: Penny keeps smoking her cigarette, glances down at the
text: photos, we catch glimpses of various bruises on parts of
text: Joker's body... A filthy crib... A rope tied to the
dialog: radiator...
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
text: Joker looking over the same black &amp; white photographs, still
dialog: HEARS his mother--
speaker_heading: MOM (V0)
dialog: I never heard him crying. Not once.
dialog: He's always been such a happy
dialog: little boy.
speaker_heading: DR. STONER (VO)
dialog: Penny, your son was found tied to a
dialog: radiator in your filthy apartment,
text: malnourished, with multiple bruises
text: across his body and severe trauma
text: to his head.
text: Joker looks up from the file when he hears/reads this, turns
text: and looks at Penny's reaction-- HE'S NOW IN THE INTERVIEW
text: ROOM WITH THEM, living what he's reading on the page.
text: He sees his mother lean forward in her chair, glaring at Dr.
dialog: Stoner--
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: That's not true. My apartment
dialog: wasn't filthy. I keep a clean
dialog: house.
text: Joker just stares at his mother.
text: Dr. Stoner looks at Penny, not sure how to respond to that.
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: DR. STONER
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And what do you have to say about
dialog: your son?
text: ANGLE ON PENNY, thinking it over, taking a drag off her
dialog: cigarette.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: I'm just glad I got to know him.
text: Joker just keeps staring at her as she exhales--

text: He is taken aback by her anger--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: No, wait,-- Sophie, we can get
dialog: through this, that's why I'm here.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: What are you talking about? What do
dialog: you think this is?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I don't know. I mean I've never
dialog: been with a woman "like that," but,
dialog: this feels like a beginning to me.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Arthur, I was just being nice to
dialog: you. I felt sorry for you. I have a

speaker_heading: JOKER

text: Some of the other mothers turn toward them--
speaker_heading: SOPHIE

speaker_heading: JOKER

speaker_heading: SOPHIE

dialog: Go back with your friends, honey.
text: Mommy's having a grown up talk.
text: Before GiGi leaves Joker looks down at her--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: No. Don't listen to her GiGi, you

speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (nods; frustrated)
dialog: Yeah, I don't know if I should
dialog: cross or uncross 'em. Both feel

text: Joker lifts his head up. He's dyed his hair green like his
text: old "Mr. Jingles" clown wig-- but he's missed spots. Some of
text: his hair is still its original color, sticking out all helter-
text: skelter.
speaker_heading: JUMP CUT:
text: Now he's smearing white grease-paint all over his face.
text: He's dancing along to the music, gyrating and thrusting his

dialog: himself.
text: He barely hears someone banging on the front door over the
dialog: loud music--
text: Doesn't answer. Joker just keeps putting on his make-up,

speaker_heading: GARY

speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: My mom died.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: (nodding)

dialog: here. Figured you might wanna go

text: Awkward beat.
speaker_heading: GARY

speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: Yeah. Another time, then. Oh hey,--

speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: Listen, the cops have been poking

dialog: all the clowns about those subway
dialog: murders and--
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: They didn't talk to me.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: (snaps at Gary)
dialog: That's because the suspect was a
dialog: regular-sized person. If it was a
dialog: fucking midget you'd be in jail
dialog: right now.
dialog: (turns back to Joker)
dialog: Anyway, Hoyt said they were looking
dialog: for me, and, and I just wanna see

dialog: our stories line up, bein' that

speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: What the fuck what the fuck WHAT
speaker_heading: THE FUCK--
text: Joker pulls them out and jams them into Randall's eye before

text: Joker grabs Randall by the head -- all of his pent up rage
text: and frustration pouring out of him -- AND SLAMS HIS HEAD
text: AGAINST THE WALL.
scene_heading: AGAIN. And AGAIN. And AGAIN.
text: Joker lets go of Randall's head, and Randall drops to the

text: Sees Gary huddled in the corner, trembling with fear--
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (catching his breath)
dialog: I'm gonna be on TV tonight. Can you
dialog: believe it?
text: Gary doesn't answer. Doesn't move--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: It's okay, Gary. You can go.
text: Gary backs away toward the door. Joker sits there for a

speaker_heading: GARY (OS)
dialog: Hey, Art?
text: Joker turns, sees Gary at the front door. He points up high
text: to the chain-lock. He can't reach it.
text: Joker just shakes his head to himself and gets up to unlock
dialog: the door.
text: He walks past Gary who's still trembling almost too afraid to
text: look up at him. Joker leans over him and undoes the chain,

scene_heading: 104 INT. STUDIO 4B, STAGE - FRANKLIN THEATER - EVENING 104
text: Studio audience filing into the studio, being seated in the
text: wide bleachers along one wall. Three TV monitors hang from
text: the ceiling, facing the audience. Three studio cameras on the
text: floor, black cables strewn everywhere.
text: The set for "LIVE WITH MURRAY FRANKLIN!" is dark... but we
text: can still make out his desk... guest chairs... Don Ellis and
text: his Jazz Orchestra's band stand... big blue curtain.
scene_heading: 105 INT. HALLWAY, FRANKLIN THEATER - EVENING 105
text: The host of the show, MURRAY FRANKLIN (60's), usually quick
text: with a bemused grin but right now in a sour mood, walks fast
text: down the hall toward the drab dressing rooms with his old-
text: school producer, GENE UFLAND (60's), who's holding the show's
text: rundown rolled up in his hand.
speaker_heading: GENE UFLAND
dialog: --You gotta see this nut for
dialog: yourself, Murray. I don't think we
text: can put him on. With the rioting
dialog: out there.
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: Jesus, Gene, I don't have time for
dialog: this. Cindy's been breaking my
dialog: balls all day.
speaker_heading: GENE UFLAND
dialog: She's still mad at you about that
dialog: thing?
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: Three marriages, you'd think I'da
dialog: fuckin' learned something.
dialog: (then)
dialog: What do I gotta see? I already know
dialog: he's a nut. That's why we're
dialog: putting him on, it's a goof.
text: A young BLONDE INTERN walks by in the opposite direction. She
text: nervously smiles to them and keeps walking. Both men turn and
text: check out her ass. Murray winks at Gene.
speaker_heading: GENE UFLAND
text: (just shakes his head, and
dialog: smiles)
dialog: I'm telling you, you gotta see him,
dialog: Murray. I think it's too risky, the
dialog: show's too big. It's worth too much
dialog: to blow it on this,-- this freak.
scene_heading: 106 INT. DRESSING ROOM, FRANKLIN THEATER - CONTINUOUS 106
text: Joker's sitting on a small couch in the cramped dressing
text: room, watching the local news on a TV that's mounted up on
text: the wall, live shots from the subway station where Burke shot
text: the protestor, footage of the City Hall rally, clashes with
dialog: police.
dialog: He's cleaned himself up as best he could... white grease-
text: paint smeared more evenly over his face, green dyed hair
text: slicked back in place. Red lips redone.
text: Murray and his producer Gene open the dressing room door
dialog: without knocking--
text: Joker gets up off the couch and goes to shake Murray's hand.
text: Murray pauses when he sees Joker's face.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (shakes Murray's hand;
dialog: effusive)
dialog: Murray, I can't believe this is
dialog: real, that I'm really here.
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: GENE UFLAND
dialog: It's Mr. Franklin kid, show some
dialog: respect.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: Oh shut up, Gene.
dialog: (to Joker)
dialog: Murray is fine. I prefer it in
dialog: fact. Thanks for coming on the
dialog: show.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Are you kidding? Thank you for the
dialog: opportunity. I've been watching you
dialog: forever. My mother never missed a
dialog: show.
text: Murray nods not listening, he's heard this before.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: So what's with the face? Are you
dialog: part of the protests?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: No, I don't believe in any of that.
dialog: I don't believe in anything. I just
dialog: thought it would be good for my
dialog: act.
speaker_heading: GENE UFLAND
dialog: (upset)
dialog: Your act? Didn't you hear that a
dialog: kid got killed on the subway and
text: two cops who were almost beat to
dialog: death? You didn't hear about the
text: dozens of protestors and police
dialog: injured in the riots?
text: Joker looks like he's about to bust out laughing. All of that
text: news is playing out on the TV above their heads. He takes a
text: deep breath. Swallows the laugh.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: No. I hadn't heard.
text: Gene and Murray share a look.
speaker_heading: GENE UFLAND
dialog: --the audience is gonna go crazy if
dialog: you put him on. It was okay maybe
dialog: for a bit, but not a whole segment.
dialog: 101.
text: Murray thinks about it for a beat.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: I like it. It's timely. It's edgy.
dialog: It's, it's dangerous. The best
dialog: comedy is all those things put
dialog: together.
dialog: (done)
dialog: We're gonna go with it.
text: Gene rubs his temples, he doesn't like this, but Murray is
dialog: the boss.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Thank you Murray.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
text: (flashes his bemused
dialog: smile; condescending)
dialog: Couple rules though,-- No cussing,
dialog: no off-color material, we do a
dialog: clean show, okay? You'll be on
dialog: after Dr. Sally. Someone will come
dialog: and get you. Good?
text: Joker nods good. Smiles back at Murray.
text: Murray and Gene turn to go, exchanging smirks with each other
text: as they walk out, making light of Joker who we see behind
text: them still standing there.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Hey Murray,-- one small thing? When
dialog: you bring me out, can you introduce
dialog: me as "The Joker"?
text: Murray and Gene look back at him
speaker_heading: GENE UFLAND
dialog: What? You don't want to use your
dialog: real name?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Honestly, I don't even know what my
dialog: real name is.
text: Joker smiles, the guys can't tell if he's kidding or not.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Besides, that's what you called me
text: on the show, Murray. A joker.
dialog: Remember?
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: (to Gene; trying not to
dialog: crack up)
dialog: Did I?
speaker_heading: GENE UFLAND
dialog: I have no idea.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: (turns back to Joker)
dialog: Well, if you say so, kid. Joker it
dialog: is.
text: Murray starts to laugh at Joker as he closes the dressing
text: room door, shutting it right in his face.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 107 INT. BACKSTAGE, BEHIND CURTAIN - STUDIO 4B - NIGHT 107
text: JOKER'S BACKSTAGE AT THE EDGE OF THE BLUE CURTAIN, trying to
text: watch the show through a slim gap. Behind him there's a
text: monitor on a cart playing the live feed.
text: He moves the curtain aside to get a better look-- Glimpses
text: Murray laughing, finishing up talking to noted sex therapist
scene_heading: DR. SALLY FRIEDMAN (60's).
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: (to Dr. Sally)
dialog: You gotta see our next guest for
dialog: yourself. Will you stick around?
dialog: Maybe you can help, I'm pretty sure
dialog: he could use a doctor.
text: The audience laughs.
scene_heading: DR. SALLY FRIEDMAN
dialog: Oh. Does he have sexual problems?
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: He looks like he's got a lot of
dialog: problems.
text: Another big laugh.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: (turns, looks into camera)
dialog: It's been a crazy few days here in
dialog: Gotham, and, I think maybe things
dialog: are about to get crazy around here
dialog: too. Don't go anywhere folks. We'll
dialog: be right back.
dialog: 103.
text: APPLAUSE SIGN LIGHTS UP. Everyone claps. Joker keeps watching
text: Murray through the slim gap at the end of the curtain. Hears
text: the floor director shout, "And we're out. Back in three."
text: Joker adjusts the waist of his pants under his jacket. Takes
text: a deep breath.
scene_heading: 108 INT. DIRECTOR'S BOOTH, STUDIO 4B - NIGHT 108
text: Perched one story above the studio. There's a long console
text: where the DIRECTOR sits in front of a gooseneck microphone,
text: looking over a double-bank of monitors.
text: Sitting next to him are the ASSOCIATE PRODUCER who times the
text: show, and the TECHNICAL DIRECTOR who operates the board. The
text: monitor showing the live feed is playing a commercial.
speaker_heading: ASSOCIATE PRODUCER
text: Back in 30 seconds.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: Okay, cue the clip. We'll come to
text: it straight out of break.
speaker_heading: ASSOCIATE PRODUCER
dialog: Five... Four... Three...
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
text: Roll clip. Put up the show graphic.
text: ON THE SHOW MONITOR, video of Joker's original stand-up
text: performance comes up with the show's graphic in the lower
text: right of the screen.
scene_heading: 109 INT. TALK SHOW SET, STAGE - STUDIO 4B - CONTINUOUS 109
text: ON THE SET, Murray watches the clip on the monitor above his
text: desk, can't help but laugh. Sees the FLOOR DIRECTOR counting
text: him down silently with her fingers... Three... Two... points
dialog: to Camera One.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: (looking into camera)
dialog: O-kay, you may have seen that clip
dialog: of our next guest when we first
dialog: played it two weeks ago. Now before
dialog: he comes out, I just want to say
dialog: that we're all heartbroken here and
dialog: sensitive to what's going on in the
dialog: city tonight. But, this is how he
dialog: wanted to come on the show. So let
dialog: me introduce-- The Joker.
dialog: 104.
text: BEHIND THE BLUE CURTAIN, Joker gathers himself, ready for his
text: moment. Doesn't hear his introduction or see a STAGEHAND pull
dialog: open the curtain for him to go out--
text: ON SET, THE CURTAIN'S OPEN, Don Ellis and his Jazz Orchestra
text: are playing Joker on. He doesn't come out. Murray looks over
text: to the empty space in the curtain.
text: The audience laughs.
text: BEHIND THE CURTAIN, Joker sees the stagehand motioning for
text: him to go out on stage. Joker starts out, pausing when he
text: takes a step into the bright lights. The stagehand doesn't
text: see him stop, and drops the curtain back on Joker before the
dialog: audience can really see his face--
text: Tangling Joker up in the curtain.
text: The audience keeps laughing thinking it's part of his act.
text: The band keeps playing him on. Joker untangles himself from
text: the curtain and the audience gets a good look at him.
text: Some continue laughing. A few boo. Most don't know what to
dialog: make of him.
text: Joker walks across the stage, forgetting to wave like he
text: practiced. He trips over the riser surrounding the set when
text: he goes to shake Murray's hand. Almost falls on him.
text: Murray tries not to crack up. The audience laughs. Thinks
dialog: it's part of Joker's act.
text: Joker reaches out to hug Dr. Sally as she goes in for a
text: handshake. Another awkward moment. More laughs.
text: Joker finally sits down next to Murray. Crosses and uncrosses
text: his legs. Can't get comfortable.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: So, ahhh, thanks for coming on the
dialog: show. But I gotta tell ya, with
dialog: what happened at City Hall today,
dialog: I'm sure many of our viewers here
dialog: in the studio, and at home, might
dialog: find this look of yours in poor
dialog: taste.
text: Joker's not listening to Murray. He's mesmerized by all the
text: lights shining on him... all the eyes on him... he doesn't
dialog: answer Murray.
text: Nervous laughter from the audience.
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: (tries again)
dialog: Can you tell us why you're dressed
dialog: like this?
text: AND JOKER STARTS TO LAUGH. Not embarrassed of it anymore. He
text: goes with it. Giving in to it, enjoying the laughter.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: (can't help but smile at
dialog: Joker's laughing)
dialog: Okay. But I'm not sure how any of
dialog: this is funny. A lot of those
dialog: protesters are going with this
text: look. City seems to be full of
dialog: clowns these days.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (just nods, still
dialog: laughing)
dialog: Yeah. Isn't it great?
text: Joker just keeps cracking up. Audience still isn't sure what
text: to make of him. There's some awkward laughter.
scene_heading: 110 INT. DIRECTOR'S BOOTH, STUDIO 4B - CONTINUOUS 110
text: Nobody's laughing in the booth.
speaker_heading: TECHNICAL DIRECTOR
dialog: (looks to the director)
dialog: This guy's got nothing.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: (hits the producer's talk
dialog: button; into the mic)
dialog: Gene, what the hell? You wanna kill
dialog: this?
scene_heading: 111 INT. TALK SHOW SET, STAGE - CONTINUOUS 111
text: Murray glances over at his producer Gene Ufland, who's
text: sitting off-camera on a director's chair by a monitor. Gene
text: shrugs at him.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: (smiles; trying to save
dialog: the interview)
dialog: So when we talked earlier, you
dialog: mentioned that you aren't
dialog: political. That this look isn't a
dialog: political statement.
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (between laughs)
dialog: That's right. I'm not political,
dialog: Murray. I'm, I'm, I'm just trying
dialog: to make people laugh.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: (beat; smiles)
dialog: How's that goin' for ya? Have you
dialog: been working on any new material?
dialog: Do you want to tell us a joke?
text: The audience claps, egging Joker on to tell a joke.
text: Joker looks over at Murray -- his laughing fit finally
text: subsiding -- and reaches into his jacket pocket and--
text: Pulls out his worn notebook, catching his breath. Looks
text: through it to find a new joke.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: You brought a joke book?
text: The audience laughs. Joker smiles, opens the page to Bruce
text: Wayne's photo, pauses for a moment then turns the page. Finds
dialog: a joke--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (reading)
dialog: Okay. Here's one. Knock knock.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: Oh god, a knock-knock joke? And you
dialog: need to read it?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (nods, reads it again)
dialog: I want to get it right. Knock
dialog: knock.
text: Murray makes a face like, "Okay, I'll go along with this."
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: Who's there?
speaker_heading: JOKER
text: (looks up from his
dialog: notebook)
dialog: It's the police, ma'am. Your son
text: has been hit by a drunk driver.
text: He's dead.
dialog: Beat.
dialog: 107.
scene_heading: 112 INT. DIRECTOR'S BOOTH, STUDIO 4B - CONTINUOUS 112
text: The associate producer tries not to laugh, but she can't help
text: it. The director looks over at her like she's lost her mind.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: Okay, ready Camera Two. Take Two.
dialog: Ready Three. Three.
text: ON THE MONITORS, some of the audience cracks up. Joker smiles
text: at the response. Murray Franklin shakes his head, smirking at
dialog: the joke despite himself.
scene_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN (ON MONITORS)
dialog: So, Arthur, you told me backstage
dialog: that your--
text: Joker leans over interrupting Murray, whispers something to
dialog: him.
scene_heading: 113 INT. TALK SHOW SET, STAGE - STUDIO 4B - CONTINUOUS 113
text: Murray nods as Joker whispers.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: (bemused smile;
dialog: patronizing)
dialog: Right. Sorry. I mean Joker-- you
dialog: told me backstage that your
dialog: mother's a big fan of the show,
dialog: that she never misses it.
text: Joker puts the notebook back in his pocket. Crosses his legs,
text: starting to get a bit more comfortable.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: That's right, Murray. But she's
dialog: dead now.
text: The audience laughs.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: (goes along with the
dialog: "joke")
dialog: Hold on. Your mother's dead?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Yeah. She is.
text: Murray's not sure if this is part of his act.
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: Okay. What about your father? Does
dialog: he watch the show?
text: Laughter from the crowd.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I don't know who my father is,
dialog: Murray. Turns out I was adopted and
dialog: sexually assaulted by my mother's
dialog: boyfriend.
text: A few in the audience groan. A couple even laugh. Still think
text: it's just Joker's edgy, off-kilter sense of humor.
text: Don Ellis plays "wha-wha-wha-whuuuuh" on his trumpet from the
dialog: band stand.
scene_heading: DR. SALLY FRIEDMAN
dialog: Ahhhh! No, no,-- You can not joke
dialog: about that.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: (shakes his head;
dialog: irritated)
dialog: Yeah, that's not funny, that's not
dialog: the kind of humor we do on this
dialog: show.
text: Murray glances over at Gene in the wings. He gives him the
dialog: "wrap it up" sign.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (just keeps going, on a
dialog: roll)
dialog: Sorry. It's been a rough few
dialog: months, Murray. I mean, after my
dialog: mother died, the police came to
dialog: question me at her funeral. Who
dialog: does that?
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: (too easy)
dialog: Oh really? Were you a suspect?
text: The audience laughs.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Very funny, Murray. No, they came
dialog: because I killed those three Wall
dialog: Street guys.
dialog: Beat.
dialog: 109.
text: Studio audience can't tell if he's joking or not. Murray
dialog: can't either.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: (looks at him confused)
dialog: Okay. I'm waiting for the
dialog: punchline.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: There is no punchline. It's not a
dialog: joke.
scene_heading: 114 INT. DIRECTOR'S BOOTH, STUDIO 4B - CONTINUOUS 114
text: The director stares at the monitor.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: Did he just confess to killing the
dialog: Wall Street Three?
speaker_heading: TECHNICAL DIRECTOR
dialog: (horrified)
dialog: Yeah. I think he did.
speaker_heading: ASSOCIATE PRODUCER
dialog: (turns to the director,
dialog: nods)
dialog: He definitely did.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: Jesus Christ.
dialog: (hits the camera talk
dialog: button, into mic)
text: Camera Three, get in close.
text: ANGLE ON MONITOR, Camera Three zooming in close on Joker's
dialog: face.
scene_heading: 115 INT. TALK SHOW SET, STAGE - CONTINUOUS 115
text: Gene Ufland is now standing up from his chair. Motions for
text: Murray to kill the interview. Murray shakes his head to
dialog: himself. This is a big "get," it could be great television.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: (turns back to Joker; with
dialog: gravitas)
dialog: You're serious, aren't you? You're
dialog: telling us you killed those three
dialog: boys on the subway. Why should we
dialog: believe you?
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I got nothing left to lose, Murray.
dialog: Nothing can hurt me anymore. This
dialog: is my fate, it was always my fate.
dialog: My life is nothing but a comedy.
scene_heading: 116 INT. SOPHIE'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 116
text: Sophie's sitting on her couch watching this interview play
text: out on TV. GiGi's asleep next to her. The open envelope and
text: the money are lying on the coffee table. No sign of the
dialog: flowers anywhere.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN (ON TV)
dialog: Let me get this straight, you think
dialog: killing those young men is funny?
speaker_heading: JOKER (ON TV)
dialog: Yeah. But comedy is subjective,
dialog: isn't that what they say? Besides,
dialog: the way I see it, what happened was
dialog: a good thing. All of you, Gotham,
dialog: the system that knows so much, you
dialog: decide, you decide what's right and
dialog: wrong. What's real or what's made
dialog: up. The same way you decide what's
dialog: funny or not.
text: Sophie edges forward on the couch, can almost see a hint of
text: agreement on her face.
scene_heading: 117 INT. TALK SHOW SET, STAGE - STUDIO 4B - CONTINUOUS 117
text: Back on set, we can tell by the way Murray's now interviewing
text: Joker, talking to him slower, more thoughtfully, that he
dialog: thinks this is gonna get him an Emmy... Maybe even a Peabody.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Okay, I think I understand. You did
dialog: it to start a movement, to become a
dialog: symbol.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: C'mon, Murray, do I look like the
dialog: kind of clown who could start a
dialog: movement? I killed those guys
dialog: because they were awful.
dialog: Everybody's awful these days. It's
dialog: enough to make anyone crazy.
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: So that's it, you're crazy. That's
dialog: your defense for killing three
dialog: young men? Because they were mean
dialog: to you?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: No. They couldn't carry a tune to
dialog: save their lives.
text: Some audible groans from the audience.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Why is everyone so upset about
dialog: these guys? Because Thomas Wayne
dialog: went and cried about them on TV?
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: You have a problem with Thomas
dialog: Wayne, too?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Yeah. I do. Everything comes so
dialog: easy for him.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: And what's wrong with that?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Have you seen what it's like out
dialog: there, Murray? Do you ever actually
dialog: leave the studio? Everybody just
text: yells and screams at each other.
dialog: Nobody's civil anymore. Nobody
dialog: thinks what it's like to be the
dialog: other guy. You think men like
dialog: Thomas Wayne, men at ease, ever
dialog: think what it's like to be a guy
dialog: like me? To be anybody but
dialog: themselves.
text: (shaking his head, voice
dialog: rising)
dialog: They don't. They think we'll all
dialog: just sit there and take it like
dialog: good little boys. That we won't
dialog: werewolf and go wild. Well, this is
dialog: for all of you out there.
text: Joker "howls at the moon." It's fucking weird.
dialog: 112.
scene_heading: 118 INT. STATION SQUAD ROOM - 7TH PRECINCT - CONTINUOUS 118
text: OFFICERS AND DETECTIVES JUMPING INTO ACTION, rushing past a
text: small portable black &amp; white television sitting on one of the
text: desks, hear one of them shout--
speaker_heading: POLICE LIEUTENANT (OS)
dialog: That asshole just confessed to
dialog: killing those Wall Street guys on
dialog: fucking live TV!
text: ANGLE ON THE LITTLE TV, TIGHT TWO-SHOT OF JOKER looking at
dialog: Murray.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN (ON TV)
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: So much self-pity, Arthur. You
dialog: sound like you're making excuses
dialog: for killing three young men. Not
dialog: everybody's awful.
scene_heading: 119 INT. TALK SHOW SET, STAGE - STUDIO 4B - CONTINUOUS 119
text: Back on set. Joker looks straight at Murray.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: You're awful, Murray.
text: There is no more laughter. The audience is watching this
text: exchange with full attention.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: Me? How am I awful?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Playing my video, inviting me on
dialog: the show,-- You just wanted to make
dialog: fun of me. Well it's easy to laugh
text: at Frankenstein on a crowded beach,
dialog: isn't it? You're just like the rest
dialog: of them, Murray. Everything comes
dialog: too easy for you.
speaker_heading: MURRAY FRANKLIN
dialog: (on the spot; defensive)
dialog: You don't know the first thing
dialog: about me, pal. Look what happened
dialog: because of what you did, Arthur,
dialog: what it led to. There are riots out
text: there. Two policemen are in
dialog: critical condition, someone was
dialog: killed today.
dialog: 113.
text: Joker nods in agreement, yeah, it's because of what he did.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: How about another joke, Murray?
dialog: What do you get when you cross a
text: mentally-ill loner with a system
text: that abandons him and treats him
dialog: like trash?
text: Murray pauses for a minute, not really listening to Joker,
text: suddenly realizing the seriousness of the situation. He
text: starts to turn to camera--
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (pulls Randall's gun)
dialog: I'll tell you what you get. You get
dialog: what you fucking deserve,--
text: And as Murray Franklin turns back to him, JOKER SHOOTS THE
scene_heading: SIDE OF MURRAY'S HEAD OFF--
text: Blood splatters all over the back of the set. Some spraying
text: in Joker's face. AUDIENCE SCREAMS! Dr. Sally dives for the
dialog: floor.
scene_heading: 120 INT. SOPHIE'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 120
text: Sophie screams and jumps to her feet horrified! Waking up
text: GiGi who starts to cry when she sees what's on television--
text: ON THE TELEVISION, Joker gets up and walks right up to the
text: camera. Blood sprayed over his white painted face. Hear the
text: studio audience still screaming, bedlam all around him.
speaker_heading: JOKER (ON TV)
dialog: (looks straight into
text: camera; screams Murray's
dialog: signature sign off)
scene_heading: GOOD NIGHT AND ALWAYS REMEMBER,--
speaker_heading: THAT'S LIFE!
text: And as Joker waves goodbye to the home audience, a black &amp;

scene_heading: "PLEASE STAND BY"

text: STAY ON JOKER'S FACE AS HE HEARS THE POLICE RADIO CRACKLING,

speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER #1 (OS)

text: only version of "Send in the Clowns" still playing...
text: Both police officers in the front seat are either unconscious
text: or dead. We see movement in the back seat, hard to tell
dialog: what's going on inside.
text: Suddenly the back door kicks open--
text: And Joker falls out of the car, landing hard on the street,
text: one hand free, handcuffs dangling from his other hand. Hear
text: sirens in the distance--
text: JOKER LEANS BACK AGAINST THE CAR, his face bloody, his body
text: broken from the crash. Sitting there amongst the wreckage,
text: can still see and hear the chaos, the fires burning all
text: around him. He reaches for a jagged shard of broken glass--
text: And pauses for moment catching his breath, hand holding the
text: jagged glass resting on his lap, wailing sirens getting

text: Blood pouring down his face, onto his hand...
text: Joker tearing into the other side of his mouth, jagged glass
text: ripping into his flesh, spurting blood, handcuff swinging--
text: Sirens on top of him, red lights flashing over his face--
text: ANGLE ON JOKER LIT UP RED, done cutting his smile, letting go

dialog: them--
text: CLOSE ON EIGHT-YEAR-OLD BRUCE WAYNE, closing his eyes as

speaker_heading: FADE IN:

text: CLOSE ON JOKER, tears in his eyes from laughing so hard. He's
text: enjoying it, not trying to get it under control.
dialog: 117.
text: His head's been shaved. He looks medicated or maybe even
text: lobotomized. Wearing white institutional clothes.
text: HIS NEW SMILE IS ALL STITCHED UP, cut deep up the corners of
text: his mouth. Forming a longer, "happier" smile.
text: He's sitting across from an overworked HOSPITAL DOCTOR
dialog: (50's), African American woman. Somehow it's the exact same
text: room Joker imagined his mother was in some 30 years ago. The
text: room and the doctor also look vaguely similar to the social
text: worker and her office in the opening scene.
text: The doctor just sits there, waiting for him to stop laughing.
text: A weathered notebook is on the table in front of him.
text: Finally, Joker stops himself.
speaker_heading: HOSPITAL DOCTOR
dialog: What's so funny?
text: He takes a deep breath, his eyes are glazed over. His voice
text: is scratchy, like he doesn't use it much.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: -- just thinking of this joke.
speaker_heading: HOSPITAL DOCTOR
dialog: Do you want to tell it to me?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JOKER

speaker_heading: HOSPITAL DOCTOR

text: ANGLE ON JOURNAL, blank page after blank page, there's
text: nothing inside of it.
text: The doctor looks up at him confused.
text: ANGLE ON JOKER, a smile creeping across his face. And we HEAR

dialog: Beat.
scene_heading: 128 INT. HALLWAY, ARKHAM STATE HOSPITAL - MORNING 128

speaker_heading: WAYNE

text: The mangle STRAIGHTENS and ROTATES from his palm to the knife
dialog: edge of his opened hand...
text: Batman CHOPS straight through the windshield- pulls his hand

text: and barrels down the circular exit ramp.
text: Batman rises. A phony batman lying on the ground watches as
text: Batman climbs up to the edge of the ten-story corkscrew ramp

dialog: After a moment he JUMPS... and falls... ten stories...

speaker_heading: RAMIREZ

scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Put this out, by morning we can put

dialog: that makeup?
text: Gordon approaches a FORENSIC PHOTOGRAPHER shooting Grumpy's

speaker_heading: RAMIREZ

dialog: The Forensic team and Ramirez leave. Gordon hands Batman

speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Him again. Who are the others?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Another bunch of small timers.
text: Batman pulls a DEVICE from his belt- moves to the bundles of

text: Batman picks up a BUNDLE. Hands it to Gordon.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Some of the marked bills I gave you.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: My detectives have been making drug
dialog: buys with them for weeks. This bank
dialog: was another drop for the mob. That
dialog: makes five banks- we've found the
dialog: bulk of their dirty cash.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Time to move in.
dialog: Gordon waves the photo.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: What about this Joker guy?
speaker_heading: BATMAN

scene_heading: 33 EXT. RAIL YARDS -- MORNING 33

speaker_heading: ALFRED

speaker_heading: ALFRED

speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: ALFRED

dialog: (looks at wound)
dialog: Did you get mauled by a tiger?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: A dog.
dialog: (off look)
dialog: A big dog. There were more copycats
dialog: last night, Alfred. With guns.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Perhaps you could hire some of them
dialog: and take weekends off.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: This wasn't exactly what I had in

speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I know. But things are improving.
dialog: Look at the new District Attorney...

speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: ALFRED

speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Know your limits, Master Wayne.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Batman has no limits.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Well, you do, sir.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I can't afford to know them.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: And what happens the day you find

speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You're flipping coins to see who

speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: My father's lucky coin. As I recall,

speaker_heading: RACHEL

speaker_heading: DENT

speaker_heading: DENT

scene_heading: 37 INT. COURTROOM, SUPERIOR COURT -- DAY 37

speaker_heading: DENT

dialog: Is this man in the courtroom today?
dialog: (Rossi nods again)
dialog: Could you identify him for us, please?

speaker_heading: ROSSI
dialog: You win, counselor. It was me.
text: Dent's smile disappears. He turns back to Rossi.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: I've got a sworn statement from you
dialog: that this man, Salvatore Maroni, is
dialog: the new head of the Falcone crime
dialog: family.
speaker_heading: ROSSI
dialog: Maroni? He's a fall guy. I'm the
dialog: brains of the organization.
text: LAUGHS from the gallery. Dent turns to the JUDGE.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: Permission to treat the witness as
dialog: hostile?
speaker_heading: ROSSI
dialog: Hostile? I'll show you hostile.
text: Rossi JUMPS UP, points a GUN at Dent's face. SCREAMS from
dialog: the gallery. Rossi PULLS the TRIGGER- the gun MISFIRES with
text: a POP. Dent steps forward, grabs the GUN- DECKS Rossi with
text: a RIGHT CROSS- unloads the GUN and sets it down in front of
dialog: Maroni.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: Ceramic 28 caliber. Made in China.
dialog: If you want to kill a public servant,

scene_heading: 38 INT. LOBBY, DENT'S OFFICE, DA'S -- DAY 38
text: Rachel, excited, leads Dent through the lobby.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: We'll never link the gun to Maroni,

dialog: tell you one thing- the fact they

scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: Glad you're so pleased, Rachel. I'm

speaker_heading: RACHEL

dialog: (smiles)
dialog: 'Course if you said you were rattled

speaker_heading: DENT

speaker_heading: DENT (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: We liaise with various agencies-
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: Save it, Gordon. I want to meet
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: GORDON

speaker_heading: DENT

scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: If you have any concerns about...

text: Dent tosses the bills back onto his desk. Annoyed.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: I've put every known money launderer

dialog: think you and your "friend" have

speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: In this town, the fewer people know

speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: Gordon, I don't like that you've got
dialog: your own special unit, and I don't
dialog: like that it's full of cops I
dialog: investigated at internal affairs.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: If I didn't work with cops you'd
dialog: investigated while you were making
dialog: your name at I.A.- I'd be working

text: Dent looks at Gordon. Considering how to proceed.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: You want me to back warrants for

speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: I can give you the names of the banks.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: Well, that's a start. I'll get you

speaker_heading: GORDON

speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Another long night?

dialog: This joint venture was your idea,
dialog: and the consultants love it, but I'm
dialog: not convinced. L.S.I.'s grown 8
dialog: percent annually, like clockwork.
dialog: They must have a revenue stream that's

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: OK. Cancel the deal.
speaker_heading: FOX

speaker_heading: RACHEL

speaker_heading: DENT

dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: RACHEL

speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: NATASCHA
dialog: (Russian accent)

speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: The famous Bruce Wayne. Rachel's

speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: RACHEL

speaker_heading: DENT

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: They should! I own the place.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: For how long? About three weeks?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: How'd you know?
speaker_heading: RACHEL

speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: NATASCHA

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I was raised here. I turned out OK.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: Is Wayne Manor in the city limits?
text: Rachel gives Dent a withering look.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: The Palisades? Sure. You know, as

dialog: out where your jurisdiction ends.
speaker_heading: NATASCHA
dialog: I'm talking about the kind of city
dialog: that idolizes a masked vigilante...
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: Gotham's proud of an ordinary man
dialog: standing up for what's right.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: NATASCHA
dialog: Gotham needs heroes like you- elected
dialog: officials, not a man who thinks he's
dialog: above the law.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Exactly. Who appointed the Batman?
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: We did. All of us who stood by and
dialog: let scum take control of our city.
text: Wayne watches Dent. Sees his passion.
speaker_heading: NATASCHA
dialog: But this is a democracy, Harvey.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: When their enemies were at the gate,
dialog: the Romans would suspend democracy
dialog: and appoint one man to protect the
dialog: city. It wasn't considered an honor.
dialog: It was considered public service.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: And the last man they asked to protect
dialog: the republic was named Caesar. He
dialog: never gave up that power.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: Well, I guess you either die a hero
dialog: or you live long enough to see
dialog: yourself become the villain. Look,
dialog: whoever the Batman is, he doesn't
dialog: want to spend the rest of his life
dialog: doing this. How could he? Batman's
dialog: looking for someone to take up his
dialog: mantle.
speaker_heading: NATASCHA
dialog: Someone like you, Mr. Dent?
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: Maybe. If I'm up to it.
text: Natascha reaches up and covers the top half of Dent's face.
speaker_heading: NATASCHA
dialog: But what if Harvey Dent is the caped
dialog: crusader?
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: If I were sneaking out every night
dialog: someone would've noticed by now.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 26.

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Well, you've sold me, Dent. I'm
dialog: gonna throw you a fundraiser.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: That's nice of you, Bruce, but I'm
dialog: not up for reelection for three years.
dialog: That stuff won't start for-

dialog: A relatively small amount: 68 million.
speaker_heading: CHECHEN
dialog: Who's stupid enough steal from us?
speaker_heading: LAU

speaker_heading: CHECHEN

speaker_heading: MARONI

dialog: The problem is our money being tracked

speaker_heading: LAU

text: From the back of the room comes LAUGHTER. It grows and grows,

speaker_heading: THE JOKER (CONT'D)
dialog: And by the way, the suit wasn't cheap.

speaker_heading: THE JOKER
dialog: A guy like me... I know why you're

dialog: why you're afraid to go out at night.
dialog: Batman. He's shown Gotham your true
dialog: colors. And Dent's just the
dialog: beginning.
dialog: (indicates Lau)
dialog: And as for his so-called plan- Batman
dialog: has no jurisdiction. He'll find him

dialog: (smiles at Lau)
dialog: I can tell the squealers every time.
speaker_heading: CHECHEN

speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Yeah? All that was left in the vaults

speaker_heading: FOX (CONT'D)
dialog: Perhaps you should read the

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Sorry.
text: Fox picks up the chest, demonstrating its flexibility.
speaker_heading: FOX

speaker_heading: GAMBOL
dialog: So. Dead you get five hundred-
text: Behind Gambol, the Joker SITS UP- THRUSTS knives into the

speaker_heading: THE JOKER (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: It won't matter. The head guys make

dialog: they can't, and they can't afford to

speaker_heading: MAYOR

speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: DENT

speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: You think I want to escape?! There's

text: Dent chuckles. A macabre sight.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: I've done plenty wrong, Gordon.

dialog: You thought we could be decent men
dialog: in an indecent world. You thought
dialog: we could lead by example. You thought
dialog: the rules could be bent but not
dialog: break... you were wrong. The world
dialog: is cruel.
dialog: (shows his coin)
dialog: And the only morality in a cruel

scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: (bitter)

speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: But you're fooling yourself if you

dialog: You're the one pointing the gun,

speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: Fair enough.

speaker_heading: GORDON

speaker_heading: DR. PAVEL

speaker_heading: CIA MAN

speaker_heading: BANE

speaker_heading: MAYOR (V.O.)
dialog: But we're here tonight because it's

dialog: 8.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAYOR (V.O.)
text: Harvey Dent's uncompromising stand
dialog: against organized crime and, yes,
dialog: ultimately, his sacrifice, have
dialog: made Gotham a safer place than it
dialog: was at the time of his death, eight
dialog: years ago...
text: ...finding a party in the grounds of Wayne Manor. The Mayor
text: addresses the wealthy and powerful of Gotham.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: This city has seen a historic
dialog: turnaround. No city is without
dialog: crime. But this city is without
dialog: organized crime because the Dent
dialog: Act gave law enforcement teeth in
text: its fight against the mob. Now
dialog: people are talking about repealing
dialog: the Dent Act. And to them I
dialog: say...not on my watch.
text: Enthusiastic applause as the Mayor wraps up.
dialog: I want to thank the Wayne

speaker_heading: MAYOR (O.S)
dialog: Now I'm going to give way to an
dialog: important voice...
dialog: 
text: Down below at the bar, Commissioner Gordon examines some
text: sheets of densely written paper. A Congressman muscles in.
speaker_heading: CONGRESSMAN
dialog: Commissioner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Congressman.
speaker_heading: CONGRESSMAN
dialog: Ever lay eyes on Wayne at one of
dialog: these things?
text: Gordon shakes his head. Gordon's Deputy Commissioner, Foley,
dialog: cuts in.
dialog: 9.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: No one has. Not in years.
speaker_heading: MAYOR (O.S)
dialog: He can tell you about the bad old
dialog: days, when the criminals and
dialog: corrupt ran this town with such a
dialog: tight grasp that people put their
text: faith in a murderous thug in a mask
text: and a cape. A thug who showed his
dialog: true nature when he betrayed the
dialog: trust of this great man - (Turns to
dialog: picture of Dent.) And murdered him
dialog: in cold blood.
text: The Congressman watches a tray of canapés breeze past, then
text: grabs the ass of the maid carrying them. She freezes.

speaker_heading: CONGRESSMAN
dialog: Sweetheart, not so fast with the
dialog: chow.
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: (turns, tight smile)
dialog: Shrimp balls?
text: The Congressman grabs two. The Maid moves off. The
text: Congressman glances down at Gordon's papers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAYOR (O.S)
dialog: Jim Gordon can tell you the truth
dialog: about Harvey Dent...
speaker_heading: CONGRESSMAN
dialog: Jesus, Gordon, is that your speech?
dialog: We're gonna be here all night.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Maybe the truth about Harvey isn't
dialog: so simple, Congressman.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAYOR (O.S)
dialog: But I'll let him tell you himself -
dialog: Commissioner Gordon?
text: Applause. Gordon approaches the mike. Looks down at his long
dialog: speech. Thinks.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: The truth...?

dialog: 10.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Gordon surveys the audience. Deciding.
dialog: I have written a speech telling the
dialog: truth about Harvey Dent...
text: Gordon folds up his speech.
dialog: Maybe the time isn't right...
text: Gordon stuffs the papers inside his jacket. The Congressman
text: mutters under his breath.
speaker_heading: CONGRESSMAN
dialog: Thank Christ for that...
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Maybe right now all you need to
dialog: know is that there are a thousand
dialog: inmates in Blackgate Prison as a
dialog: direct result of the Dent Act.
dialog: These are violent criminals,
dialog: essential cogs in the organized
dialog: crime machine that terrorized
dialog: Gotham for so long. Maybe, for now,
dialog: all I should say about Harvey
dialog: Dent's death is this...it has not
dialog: been for nothing.
text: The figure on the balcony turns back into the mansion.
text: People clap as Gordon leaves the mike. Gordon approaches
dialog: Foley.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: The second shift reports in?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: On your desk. But you should put in
dialog: some more time with the Mayor -
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: That's your department.
dialog: 
text: Gordon heads for the line of town cars in the gravel drive.
speaker_heading: CONGRESSMAN
dialog: Anyone shown him the crime stats?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
text: He goes by his gut, and it
dialog: continues to bother him, whatever
dialog: the numbers.
speaker_heading: CONGRESSMAN
dialog: Must be popular with the wife.
dialog: 11.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Not really. She took the kids and
dialog: moved to Cleveland.
speaker_heading: CONGRESSMAN
dialog: He'll have plenty of time for
text: visits. Mayor's dumping him in the
dialog: spring.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Really? He's a hero.

speaker_heading: CONGRESSMAN

speaker_heading: MAID 3
dialog: I heard he had an accident - that

speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Mr. Till, why are your people using
dialog: the main stairs?
text: Alfred places a glass of water on a tray next to a covered

speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Where's Mrs. Bolton?
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: She's up at the bar, sir. Can I
dialog: help?
dialog: 
text: Alfred looks at the Maid. Hands her a key and the tray.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
text: The East drawing room. Unlock the

dialog: 12.

scene_heading: INT. HALL, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Alfred talks to an elegant woman, thirties, Miranda Tate.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I'm sorry, Miss Tate, but I've
dialog: tried. He won't see you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: It's important, Mr. Pennyworth.
text: Her accent is European. Hard to place.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
text: Mr. Wayne is as determined to
dialog: ignore important things as trivial
dialog: ones.
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Don't take it personally, Miranda.
dialog: 
text: They turn to see a man in his fifties. Daggett.
speaker_heading: DAGGETT
dialog: Everyone knows Wayne's holed up in
text: there with eight-inch nails, peeing
dialog: into Mason jars. (To Alfred.) Good
dialog: of you to let me on the grounds.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: The Dent Act is about all Gotham.
dialog: Even you, Mr. Daggett. Miss Tate,
dialog: always a pleasure.
text: Alfred turns and walks off. Daggett smiles, glib.

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAGGETT
dialog: Why waste your time talking to the
dialog: man who threw away your investment
dialog: on some save-the-world vanity
dialog: project? He can't help you get your
dialog: money back. But I can.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I could try explaining that a
dialog: save-the-world project, vain or
dialog: not, is worth investing in,
dialog: whatever the return. I could try,
dialog: Mr. Daggett, but you understand
dialog: only money and the power you think
dialog: it buys, so why waste my time,
dialog: indeed?

scene_heading: INT. DRAWING ROOM, EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS
text: Close on the dinner tray. We hear a labored step approach.

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SITTING ROOM, EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR, CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: The Maid looks at framed photographs of Rachel, Thomas and
text: Martha Wayne. Some are half-burned. She notices an archery
text: target, arrows stuck in it. She reaches out. WHAM! An arrow
text: sticks into the target - the Maid spins around, flustered.
text: Wayne, at the other end of the long room, lowers a composite
text: bow. Picks up his cane.
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: I'm, I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Wayne.
dialog: It is Mr. Wayne, isn't it?
dialog: 
text: Wayne nods, gently. Limps towards her.
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: Although you don't have the long
dialog: nails... (Nervous laugh.) Or facial
dialog: scars...
text: She trails off, embarrassed. Coy. She seems very young.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Is that what they say about me?
dialog: 14.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: It's just that...nobody sees you...
dialog: 
text: Wayne approaches slowly. He nods at her pearl necklace.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: That's a beautiful necklace.
dialog: Reminds me of the one that belonged
dialog: to my mother. It can't be the same
dialog: one - her pearls are in this safe -
text: He reaches out with his cane to press open a panel on the
text: bureau, revealing a safe door...
dialog: - which the manufacturer clearly
text: explained is uncrackable.
dialog: 
text: ...which swings open with an awkward creak.
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: Oops. No one told me it was
text: uncrackable.
dialog: 
text: The Maid suddenly seems more confident. Older.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I'm afraid I can't let you take
dialog: those.
dialog: 
text: She smiles at him. Moves towards him.
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: Look, you wouldn't hit a woman any
dialog: more than I would beat up a
dialog: cripple.
text: She kicks his cane from under him, smashes him down.
dialog: Of course, sometimes exceptions
dialog: have to be made.
dialog: 
text: The Maid vaults onto the bureau and up to a high window.
dialog: Goodnight, Mr. Wayne.
text: She flips backwards through the window. Wayne smiles, then
text: rocks forward on his good leg and rises with athletic grace.
text: He looks at the safe, notices something. Powder...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVE, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS
text: Moving toward the line of town cars, the Maid pulls off her

speaker_heading: MAID

speaker_heading: ALFRED

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: She's very persistent.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: And quite lovely, in case you were
dialog: wondering.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I wasn't.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: What are you doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: And this is your idea of raising

speaker_heading: WAYNE
speaker_heading: (SHRUGS)
text: She took the pearls. Tracking

speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: She?

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: One of the maids, perhaps you
dialog: should stop letting them in this
text: side of the house.
dialog: 16.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Perhaps you should learn to make

speaker_heading: GORDON

speaker_heading: BLAKE

speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: That's a job for the police?
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Sir, I've been a cop for a year and

speaker_heading: GORDON

speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: It's that night. This night, eight
dialog: years ago. The night Dent died.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: What about it?
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: The last confirmed sighting of the

speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: I'm not hearing a question, son.
dialog: 
text: Blake shifts uneasily. Then looks at Gordon.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Don't you want to know who we was?
text: Gordon turns to look at the broken searchlight. He brushes

speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: I know exactly who he was. (Turns
dialog: to Blake.) He was Batman.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: You haven't been down here in a
dialog: long time...
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Just trying to find out more about
dialog: our jewel thief. I ran her prints
dialog: from the photos she handled -
text: Wayne pulls up a mug shot - a fat, male armed-robbery
dialog: suspect.
dialog: - but she was wearing someone
dialog: else's fingerprints. She's good.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: She may be. But we have the trace
text: on the necklace.

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: We do, so I cross-referenced the

speaker_heading: ALFRED

speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: And that's the problem. You hung up
text: the cape and cowl, but never moved
dialog: on. You won't get out there and
dialog: find a life. Find someone -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
speaker_heading: (BITTER)
dialog: I did find someone, Alfred.
dialog: 20.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I know. And then you lost them.
dialog: That's part of living, sir. But
dialog: you're not living - you're waiting.
text: Hoping for things to go bad again.
dialog: 
text: Wayne says nothing.
dialog: Remember when you left Gotham?
dialog: Before all this. Before Batman.
dialog: Seven years you were gone. Seven
dialog: years I waited. Hoping that you
dialog: wouldn't come back.
text: Wayne looks at Alfred. Not understanding.
dialog: Every year I took my holiday. I'd
dialog: go to Florence. There's a café by
dialog: the Arno... Any fine evening I
dialog: would sit there and order a Fernet
dialog: Branca...
text: INSERT CUT: Alfred seated in a café sipping his drink...
dialog: I had a fantasy. I liked to imagine
dialog: that one day I'd look across the
dialog: tables, and see you. Sitting there
dialog: with your wife. Perhaps some kids.
dialog: You wouldn't say anything to me, or
dialog: me to you, but we'd both
dialog: know...that you'd made it. That you
dialog: were happy.
dialog: 
text: INSERT CUT: Alfred spots a couple at another table and looks
text: closer, hopeful. But they are strangers.
dialog: I never wanted you to come back to
dialog: Gotham. I knew there was nothing
dialog: there for you but pain and tragedy,
dialog: and I wanted more for you than
dialog: that. I still do.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DWP MAN
dialog: They wash up a couple times a

text: homeless sheltering in the tunnels.
dialog: We had to pull him to clear the

dialog: didn't touch him...

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: They come out by the catchment basin. Above the grille lies

speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLAKE

speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: FATHER REILLY
dialog: You know why, Blake - he aged out.
dialog: We don't have the resources to keep
dialog: boys on after sixteen -
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: The Wayne Foundation gives money
dialog: for that -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER REILLY
dialog: Not for two years now.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: He has a brother here, right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER REILLY
dialog: Mark. I'll tell him.
speaker_heading: BLAKE

speaker_heading: BLAKE

speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: What was he doing in the tunnels?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Lot of guys been going down the
dialog: tunnels when they age out. Say you
dialog: can live down there. Say there's
dialog: work down there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: What kind of work are you gonna
dialog: find in the sewers?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: More than you can find up here, I
dialog: guess.
text: Blake considers this. Troubled.

scene_heading: INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT
text: Selina Kyle, in a little black dress, walks in with a drunk
text: in a Hawaiian shirt. She sits him on a bar stool - walks
text: over to a table where a neatly dressed man, Stryver, sits.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STRYVER
dialog: You brought a date?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I like having someone around to
dialog: open doors for me.
dialog: 
text: Selina glances around. Things scattered throughout the bar.
text: Jumpy. Selina hands an envelope to Stryver.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Right hand. No partials.
text: Stryver slides a transparency out of the envelope. Holds it
text: up to the light. Four perfect fingerprint transfers.
dialog: 23.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STRYVER
dialog: Very nice.
text: He pockets the envelope.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Not so fast, handsome. You got
dialog: something for me?
speaker_heading: STRYVER
dialog: Oh, yes.
dialog: 
text: Stryver signals a Thug who locks the door. Another Thug
text: joins them at the table. Selina smiles.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I don't know what you're going to
dialog: do with Mr. Wayne's prints...but
dialog: I'm guessing you'll need his thumb.
text: As Stryver checks the envelope again -
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: You don't count so good, huh?
speaker_heading: STRYVER
dialog: I count fine.
text: The Second Thug puts a gun to Selina's head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STRYVER
dialog: In fact, I'm counting to ten right
dialog: now...
text: Selina looks in his eyes. The Thug cocks his gun. She
text: blinks.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Okay, okay -
dialog: 
text: She reaches for her purse. The Thug stops her, reaches in
text: himself - pulls out a cellphone. Slides it across the table.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: My friend is waiting outside. Just
dialog: hit 'send'...
dialog: 
text: Stryver looks at the phone. Hits 'send'. Selina sizes up her
text: options. A knock on the door. Second Thug hides his gun. The
text: door opens - a young woman, Jen. She enters, cheerful, spots
text: Selina. Pulls out an envelope, looks around.
dialog: 24.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEN
text: Place is a little dead.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: (takes envelope, tense)
dialog: It'll liven up in a minute, trust
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Everything okay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Great. Catch you later.
text: Jen leaves. Stryver checks the envelope. Satisfied.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: It would've been a lot easier to
dialog: just give me what we agreed.
speaker_heading: STRYVER
dialog: We can't have loose ends. And even
dialog: in that dress, no one's going to
dialog: miss you.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: No. But my friend over there...?
text: Stryver looks at Selina's 'date' drooling into a bowl of
text: nuts at the bar - he looks familiar...
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Every cop in the city's missing
dialog: him.
dialog: 
text: Across the bar, the TV on mute -
text: MANHUNT FOR MISSING CONGRESSMAN.
text: Stryver looks at Selina.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STRYVER
dialog: Cute. But they're not gonna be
dialog: looking in a place like this.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I don't know... You did just use
text: his cell phone.
text: Stryver glances down at the cell phone as - SCREECH - the
text: Thugs look out the window at cop cars and SWAT units
text: descending on the bar. Stryver glances at the window and -
text: SMASH - Selina CRACKS his head against the table, grabs
dialog: 25.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Second Thug's gun hand, flips over the table, firing at the
text: other Thugs, who drop. The SWATs batter down the door.
text: Selina crouches, cowering, screaming.
speaker_heading: SWAT
dialog: It's alright, Miss. Just stay down
dialog: -
text: The SWATs barrel past, chasing the remaining Thugs back

scene_heading: EXT. DIVE BAR - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: There's a man in there - he's
dialog: bleeding!
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: It's okay, Miss. It's okay.
dialog: 
text: Blake helps Selina down onto the tailgate of a SWAT truck.

scene_heading: INT. DIVE BAR - CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: The SWATs return fire. The Thugs lay down cover fire, then
text: race around a corner into a smaller passage.
text: A cop car pulls up, blocking the mouth of the alley - Gordon
text: jumps out, gun drawn.
dialog: 
text: The SWATs approach the passage, massing on both corners
text: tactically. The two corner SWATs exchange hand signals,
text: counting down... They round the corner, aiming low and high.
text: The passage is empty.
dialog: 
text: The SWATs cover a fire escape, but Gordon spots at once -
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Manhole!
dialog: 
text: He races to the manhole cover - SWATs wrench off the cover,
text: Gordon grabs a flashlight from the nearest SWAT.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: You three, down with me. You two,
text: head down to cover the next exit -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SWAT
dialog: Where -?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Get the DWP down here, now!
dialog: 
text: Gordon starts climbing down the ladder...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SEWERS - CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: COP

speaker_heading: BLAKE

speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: (shaking his head)
text: And Gordon took SWAT in after them.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SEWERS - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Gordon hears a noise up ahead - pushes forward, rounds the
text: corner. BANG! GUNFIRE. SWATs return fire, shots sparking off
text: the concrete walls, then - BOOM - behind him the tunnel
text: ERUPTS IN FIRE, blasting the SWATs. Gordon races forward,
text: tearing through the tunnels.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - CONTINUOUS

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SEWERS - CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - CONTINUOUS
text: Blake pushes forward.
speaker_heading: BLAKE

speaker_heading: COP

speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Gas? This is a sewer!
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: No one goes in there till we know

speaker_heading: BLAKE

dialog: Police Commissioner!
speaker_heading: FOLEY

speaker_heading: THUG 2
dialog: What do we do?

speaker_heading: THUG 1
dialog: Take him to Bane.
text: The two Thugs drag Gordon down through the maze of tunnels.
text: As they descend deeper they encounter work crews of muscular
text: men wielding large drills and jackhammers, working the walls
text: and ceiling of the larger tunnels. Some of the men are armed
text: Mercenaries, overseeing gangs of homeless street kids. They
text: stare as Gordon is dragged past. The Thugs drag Gordon
dialog: between two waterfalls, into -
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BANE'S LAIR, SEWERS - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)
text: They approach a figure, turned away, crouched in the

text: line of scar tissue runs the length of his spine...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: Why are you here?
text: The Thugs drop Gordon at Bane's feet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THUG 1
dialog: Answer him!
text: Bane slowly turns to the Thugs.
dialog: 29.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: I'm asking you.
speaker_heading: THUG 1
dialog: It's the Police Commissioner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: And you brought him down here?
speaker_heading: THUG 2
dialog: We didn't know what to do. We -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: You panicked. And your weakness
dialog: costs three lives.
speaker_heading: THUG 1
dialog: No, he's alone -
text: Bane flips the Thug's chin up and to the side with a crack.
text: Thug 1 drops. Bane turns to Thug 2.
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: Search him. Then I will kill you.
text: The Thug, terrified, pulls out Gordon's badge, wallet,
text: gun...and the folded papers of the speech he did not read.
text: Bane takes these one by one with quick glances. He stops at
text: the papers. Unfolds them...
dialog: 
text: As he reads, Gordon rolls off the steps, dropping into the
text: rushing flow of water - gunshots ring out...
speaker_heading: THUG 2
text: He's dead.
dialog: 
text: Thug 2 trails off as Bane looks up from the papers...
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: Then show me his body.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THUG 2
dialog: That water runs to any one of the
dialog: outflows - we'd never find him.
text: Bane turns to the Lead Mercenary.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: Give me your GPS.
text: Lead Mercenary hands him a GPS - Bane tucks it into Thug 2's
text: jacket, zips it up like a mother sending her kid to school.
dialog: 30.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: Follow him.
speaker_heading: THUG 2
dialog: Follow him?
dialog: 
text: Bane shoots Thug 2, kicks him into the water. Turns to Lead

speaker_heading: ALFRED

text: unscheduled calls. Even from police
dialog: officers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: And if I go get a warrant, in the
dialog: investigation of Harvey Dent's

dialog: unscheduled?

scene_heading: INT. STUDY, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: BLAKE
text: Commissioner Gordon's been shot.
dialog: 31.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I'm sorry to hear that -
speaker_heading: BLAKE
text: He chased a gunman down into the
dialog: sewers. When I pulled him out he
text: was babbling about an underground
text: army. A masked man called 'Bane'.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Shouldn't you be telling this to
dialog: your superior officers?
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: I did. One of them asked if he saw
dialog: any giant alligators down there. He
dialog: needs you. He needs the Batman.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: If Commissioner Gordon thinks I'm
dialog: the Batman he must be in a bad way
dialog: -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: He doesn't know or care who you
dialog: are. (Off look.) But we've met
dialog: before. When I was a kid. At the
dialog: orphanage. See, my mom died when I
dialog: was small. Car accident, I don't
dialog: really remember it. But a couple of
dialog: years later my dad was shot over a
dialog: gambling debt. I remember that just
dialog: fine. (Looks at Wayne.) Not a lot
dialog: of people who know what it feels
dialog: like, do they? To be angry. In your
dialog: bones. People understand, foster
text: parents understand. For a while.
dialog: Then they expect the angry kid to
dialog: do what he knows he can never do.
dialog: To move on. To forget.
dialog: 
text: Wayne stares at Blake.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: So they stopped understanding and
text: sent the angry kid to a boys' home
dialog: - St. Swithin's. Used to be funded
dialog: by the Wayne Foundation. See, I
dialog: figured it out too late. You have
dialog: to hide the anger. Practice smiling
dialog: in the mirror. Like putting on a
dialog: mask. You showed up one day in a
dialog: cool car, pretty girl on your arm.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 32.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: We were so excited - Bruce Wayne,
dialog: billionaire orphan. We made up
dialog: stories about you. Legends. The
dialog: other boys' stories were just that.
dialog: But when I saw you I knew who you
dialog: really were... (Beat.) I'd seen
dialog: that look on your face. Same one I
dialog: taught myself.
text: Blake gets up to leave. Wayne is lost in thought.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: I don't know why you took the fall
dialog: for Dent's murder, but I'm still a
dialog: believer in the Batman. Even if
dialog: you're not.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Why did you say your boys' home
dialog: used to be funded by the Wayne
dialog: Foundation?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Because the money stopped. Might be
dialog: time to get some fresh air and
dialog: start paying attention to the

scene_heading: INT. HALL, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: You checked that name? 'Bane' -
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Ran it through some databases. He's
dialog: a mercenary. No other known name.
dialog: Never been seen or photographed
text: without a mask. He and his men were

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Time to talk to Mr. Fox, I think.
speaker_heading: ALFRED

speaker_heading: ALFRED
speaker_heading: (LIGHTS UP)
dialog: One or two.
speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: (RISING)
dialog: Mr. Fox, are you aware that John

dialog: in Wayne Enterprises?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I was not. But it wouldn't do him
dialog: any good - Mr. Wayne still retains

speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Bruce Wayne. As I live and breathe.

speaker_heading: FOX

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I see you haven't lost your sense
dialog: of humor...even if you have lost
dialog: most of my money.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Actually, you did that yourself.
dialog: See, if you funnel the entire R and
dialog: D budget for five years into a
dialog: fusion project that you then
dialog: mothball, your company is unlikely
dialog: to thrive.
dialog: 35.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FOX
text: A wildly sophisticated CEO, yes.
dialog: Wayne Enterprises is running out of

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: What're my options?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: If you're not willing to turn your
dialog: machine on -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I can't, Lucius.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Then sit tight. Your majority keeps
dialog: Daggett at arm's length while we
dialog: figure out a future for the energy

dialog: She's smart, and quite lovely.
speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: FOX

speaker_heading: FOX

speaker_heading: FOX

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: It's fine the use it gets these

speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Well, then I have just the thing

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: What's it called?
speaker_heading: FOX
text: It has a long and uninteresting
dialog: Wayne Enterprises designation. So I
dialog: took to calling it the Bat. And
dialog: yes, Mr. Wayne, it does come in
dialog: black.
text: Wayne touches its sleek side. Marveling.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Works great except for the
text: autopilot.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: What's wrong with that?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Software-based instability. Take a
dialog: better mind than mine to fix it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Better mind?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I was trying to be modest. A less
dialog: busy mind. Yours, perhaps.
text: Wayne looks wistfully at the machine. Turns away.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I told you. I retired, Lucius.

scene_heading: INT. EXAMINATION ROOM, GOTHAM GENERAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT
text: Wayne listens, distracted, while a Doctor examines an X-ray.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: I've seen worse cartilage in knees
dialog: -
dialog: 38.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: That's good -
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: No, that's because there is no
dialog: cartilage in your knee. And not
dialog: much of any use in your elbows and
dialog: shoulders. Between that and the
dialog: scar tissue on your kidneys,
dialog: residual concussive damage to your
dialog: brain tissue and general
dialog: scarred-over quality of your
dialog: body... (Takes a deep breath.) I
dialog: cannot recommend that you go
text: heli-skiing. About the only part of
dialog: your body that looks healthy is
dialog: your liver, so if you're bored I
dialog: recommend you take up drinking, Mr.
dialog: Wayne.
text: Wayne smiles. The Doctor leaves. Wayne pulls on a ski mask,
text: steps to the window, hops up, pulls a wire from his cane,
text: which he clips to his belt. He props his cane behind the
text: frame - jumps out. The wire unspools from the cane as -

scene_heading: INT. PRIVATE ROOM, GOTHAM GENERAL - CONTINUOUS
text: Gordon lies in his bed, hooked up to machines. Wayne, in ski
text: mask, stands over him. Gordon's eyes flutter open. He tries
text: to speak with a weak, hoarse voice...
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: We were in this together. Then you
dialog: were gone...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: The Batman wasn't needed anymore.
dialog: We won.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Built on a lie. Our lie. Now
dialog: there's evil rising from where we
dialog: tried to bury it. Nobody will
dialog: listen... The Batman has to come
dialog: back.
dialog: 39.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: What if he doesn't exist anymore?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: He must. He must.

scene_heading: INT./EXT. LAMBORGHINI ON GOTHAM STREETS - NIGHT

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SELINA'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: Selina sits in a small room getting ready to go out. She

speaker_heading: JEN (O.S.)
dialog: I told you - money first -
speaker_heading: YUPPIE (O.S.)
dialog: Goddammit, you took my wallet!
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL OUTSIDE SELINA'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: The Yuppie has Jen against the wall - he reaches back to hit
text: her with an expensive wristwatch-clad arm. But Selina has
text: grabbed his wrist with a powerful grip.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Get out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YUPPIE
dialog: She took my wallet!
text: Selina twists his arm behind him in a blinding move.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Now.
text: She releases the Yuppie, who moves off down the stairs.
text: Selina turns to Jen. Who is examining a wallet.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I told you not to try it with the
dialog: assholes, Jen.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: They're all assholes.
dialog: 40.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Okay, the assholes who hit.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: I don't know what he's so upset
dialog: about, he only had sixty bucks in
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Probably the watch.

speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Watch?

scene_heading: EXT. SELINA'S BUILDING, OLD TOWN, GOTHAM - LATER

scene_heading: EXT. MUSEUM, GOTHAM - LATER
text: Town cars dispense Gotham society in tasteful masquerade.

speaker_heading: PAPARAZZI
dialog: Another stiff too old to climb out
text: of his sports car.
speaker_heading: PAPARAZZI 2
dialog: No, that's Bruce Wayne! Hey, Wayne,
dialog: where you been hiding?
text: Lenses swing onto Wayne, who pushes a button on his key fob
text: - a pulse. The cameras die. Wayne heads to the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I'm not sure if my assistant put me
dialog: on the guest list -
speaker_heading: GREETER
dialog: Right through here, Mr. Wayne...
dialog: 41.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MUSEUM - CONTINUOUS
text: A lavish ball - the expressively attired dance under falling
text: confetti... Even Bruce Wayne is struck by the ostentation.
text: He spots Selina dancing with a deeply smitten Rich Twit. She
text: wears a small, velvet pair of cat ears. And the pearls.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIRANDA (O.S)
dialog: Bruce Wayne at a charity ball?
text: Wayne turns to find Miranda Tate, amazed, a small mask her
dialog: only concession to fancy dress.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Miss Tate, isn't it?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Even before you became a recluse,
dialog: you never came to these things...
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: True. Proceeds go to the big fat
dialog: spread, not the cause. It's not
dialog: about charity, it's about feeding
dialog: the ego of whichever society hag
dialog: laid it on.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Actually, this is my party, Mr.
dialog: Wayne.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: And the proceeds will go where they
dialog: should, because I paid for the big
dialog: fat spread myself.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: That's very generous of you.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You have to invest to restore
dialog: balance to the world. Take our
dialog: clean-energy project...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Sometimes the investment doesn't
dialog: pay off. Sorry.
dialog: 42.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You have a practiced apathy, Mr.
dialog: Wayne. But a man who doesn't care
dialog: about the world doesn't spend half
dialog: his fortune on a plan to save it...
dialog: (Gentle.) And isn't so wounded when
dialog: it fails that he goes into
dialog: hiding...
text: Wayne looks at Miranda. Intrigued.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Have a good evening, Mr. Wayne.
text: Wayne watches Miranda glide away. Then turns to Selina.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Mind if I cut in?
text: Rich Twit turns, annoyed - Wayne hands him his cane. Takes
text: Selina by the waist. She glares at him.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: You don't seem very happy to see
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: You were supposed to be a shut-in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Felt like some fresh air.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Why didn't you call the police?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I have a powerful friend who deals
dialog: with this kind of thing. (Admires
text: her cat ears.) Brazen costume for a
text: cat burglar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Yeah? Who are you pretending to be?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
text: Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire.
dialog: Who's your date?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: His wife's in Ibiza. She left her
text: diamonds behind, though. Worried
dialog: they'd get stolen.
dialog: 43.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: It's pronounced 'Ibeetha'. You
dialog: wouldn't want these folks realizing
dialog: you're a crook not a social
dialog: climber.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: (flash of anger)
dialog: You think I care what anyone in
dialog: this room thinks about me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I doubt you care what anyone in
dialog: this room thinks about you.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Don't condescend, Mr. Wayne. You
dialog: don't know a thing about me.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Well, Selina Kyle, I know you came
dialog: here from your walk-up in Old Town
dialog: - modest place for a master jewel
dialog: thief. Which means either you're
dialog: saving for your retirement - or
dialog: you're in deep with the wrong
dialog: people.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: You don't get to judge me because
dialog: you were born in the master bedroom
dialog: of Wayne Manor.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Actually, I was born in the Regency
dialog: Room.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I started off doing what I had to.
dialog: Once you've done what you had to
dialog: they'll never let you do what you
dialog: want to.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Start fresh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: There's no fresh start in today's
dialog: world. Any twelve-year-old with a
dialog: cell phone could find out what you
dialog: did. Everything we do is collated
text: and quantified. Everything sticks.
dialog: We are the sum of our mistakes.
dialog: 44.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Or our achievements.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: The mistakes stick better. Trust
dialog: me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: You think that justifies stealing?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I take what I need to from those
dialog: who have more than enough. I don't
dialog: stand on the shoulders of people
dialog: with less.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Robin Hood?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I'd do more to help someone than
text: most of the people in this room.
dialog: Than you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Maybe you're assuming too much.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Or maybe you're being unrealistic
dialog: about what's really in your pants
dialog: other than your wallet.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Ouch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: You think all this can last?
text: Wayne glances around at the sumptuous party.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne.
dialog: You and your friends better batten
text: down the hatches, because when it
dialog: hits you're all gonna wonder how
dialog: you ever thought you could live so
dialog: large and leave so little to the
dialog: rest of us.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Sounds like you're looking forward
dialog: to it.
dialog: 45.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I'm adaptable.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: These pearls do look better on you
dialog: then they did in my safe...
dialog: 
text: Wayne rolls her into his shoulder - reaches up to the back
text: of her neck, unclasps the necklace.
dialog: But I still can't let you keep
dialog: them.
dialog: 
text: The pearls slide off her neck into his other hand. Selina
text: looks at him. Angry. Then kisses him, hard, and disappears
text: into the crowd. Wayne's cane reappears.
speaker_heading: RICH TWIT
speaker_heading: (ANNOYED)
dialog: You scared her off.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Not likely.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MUSEUM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Wayne approaches the Valet. Pats down his pockets.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I must have lost my ticket -
speaker_heading: VALET
dialog: Your wife said you were taking a
dialog: cab home, sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: My wife?

scene_heading: INT./EXT. LAMBORGHINI RACING DOWN STREETS - CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: INT. ROLLS ROYCE - LATER
dialog: 
text: Alfred watches in the mirror as Wayne climbs into the back.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Just you, sir?
dialog: 
text: Wayne gives him a withering glare.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 46.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFRED (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't worry, Master Wayne. Takes a
dialog: little time to get back into the
dialog: swing of things.
text: Wayne dials his phone.
speaker_heading: FOX (O.S.)
dialog: This is Fox.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Remember those 'unusual requests' I
dialog: used to make?
speaker_heading: FOX (O.S.)
dialog: I knew it!
text: Up front, Alfred listens. Concerned.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BATCAVE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Wayne pushes a button on a hi-tech carbon fiber brace
text: strapped to his good knee - the brace tones. As Wayne starts
text: moving his knee, bending, stretching, Alfred puts down a
dialog: Thermos.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: You've got the wrong leg, sir.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: You start with the good limb so it
dialog: learns your optimum muscle
dialog: patterns.
text: Wayne swaps the brace to his bad knee. Puts his weight on it
text: - the knee bends, kicks. He sits again. Cautious.
dialog: Now we tighten it up.
dialog: 
text: Wayne gingerly pushes a button - the brace starts to shrink
text: tight to his leg, digging in. Wayne grits his teeth.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: It is terribly painful?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
speaker_heading: (GRITTED TEETH)
dialog: You're welcome to try it, Alfred.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Happy watching, thank you, sir.
text: Wayne shouts as the brace clicks home. He gets to his feet.
dialog: 47.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Not bad -
text: Wayne executes a perfect roundhouse, knocking out a brick.
dialog: Not bad at all.
dialog: 
text: Alfred picks up the brick. Considers it. Uneasy. He follows
text: Wayne across the bridge to the cube.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Master Wayne, if you're considering
dialog: going back out there you need to
dialog: hear some rumors surrounding Bane.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I'm all ears.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFRED
text: There is a prison. In a more
text: ancient part of the world. A pit.
dialog: Where men are thrown to suffer and
dialog: die. But sometimes, a man rises
dialog: from the darkness. Sometimes...the
text: pit sends something back.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Bane.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
text: Born and raised in a hell on earth.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Born in a prison?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: No one knows why. Or how he
dialog: escaped. But they know who trained
dialog: him one he did...R¯'s al Gh¯l. Your
speaker_heading: A U
dialog: mentor.
dialog: 
text: Wayne takes this in. Shocked.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
text: He plucked Bane from a dark corner
dialog: of the earth and trained him in the
dialog: blackest disciplines of combat,
dialog: deception and endurance. Just like
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Bane was a member of the League of
dialog: Shadows.
dialog: 48.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFRED
text: Until he was excommunicated. And a
dialog: man considered too extreme for R¯'s
dialog: A
dialog: al Gh¯l is not to be trifled with.
speaker_heading: U
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I didn't realize I was known for
text: trifling with criminals.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: That was then. And you can strap up
dialog: your leg and put the mask back on.
dialog: But it won't make you what you
dialog: were.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Which was?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Someone whose anger at death made
dialog: him value all life. Even his own.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: If this man is all the things you
dialog: say he is, then this city needs me.
text: The Batsuit emerges from the cube.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Yes, this city needs Bruce Wayne.
dialog: Your resources, your
dialog: knowledge...not your body. Not your
text: life. That time has passed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I tried helping as Bruce Wayne,
dialog: Alfred. And I failed.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: You can fail as Bruce Wayne. As
dialog: Batman, you can't afford to.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: That's what you're afraid of - that
dialog: if I go back out there I'll fail.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: No. I'm afraid that you want to.
text: Wayne looks at Alfred. Then turns to examine the Batsuit.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRADER 2
dialog: You can't short the stock because
text: Bruce Wayne goes to a party -
speaker_heading: TRADER 1
dialog: Wayne coming back is change. Change
dialog: is either good or bad.
speaker_heading: TRADER 2
dialog: On what basis?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRADER 1
dialog: I flipped a coin.
text: Near the front entrance: a Food Delivery Guy is standing
text: there negotiating with a Trader.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRADER 3
dialog: No. Rye. I told 'em rye.
text: Trader 3 spots bad news on a screen.
dialog: Alright, I'll take it.
dialog: 
text: He thrusts Food Guy a tip and grabs the bag, distracted...
text: At the rear secure entrance: a Motorcycle Courier enters,
text: wearing his helmet - a Female Security Guard gets in his
dialog: face.
dialog: 
scene_heading: FEMALE SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Rookie! Lose the helmet! (Points at
dialog: a camera.) We need faces for
dialog: cameras.
dialog: 
text: In the rest room: a Janitor mops the floor, shifting out of
text: the way of two Traders who rush in to pee.
text: At the shoeshine stand, Trader 1 waves a bill down at the
text: man shining his shoes without a glance. Shoeshine Man takes
text: the bill, then, as the Traders step off, he reaches into a
text: gym bag and checks an automatic weapon. He clicks the slide
text: home, then hoists the gym bag and heads for the trading
dialog: floor.
text: At the secure entrance: the Courier pulls off his helmet.
text: The Female Security Guard's eyes go wide.
dialog: 50.
dialog: 
text: In the rest room: the Janitor reaches into his bucket and
text: pulls out a machine pistol in a Ziploc bag.
dialog: 
text: Near the front entrance: Food Guy pulls an automatic pistol
text: - clubs Trader 3 with it, pastrami flying. Shoeshine Man
text: moves onto the floor, pulls out his weapon.
text: Under the Courier's helmet - a mask. Bane. He grabs the
text: Female Security Guard and throws her into her colleagues,
text: lashing out in four directions with rapidfire lethality.
text: Shoeshine Man fires into the large trading screens. The
text: floor erupts into a different frenzy - traders hit the deck,
text: screaming. Bane moves onto the floor...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRADER 1
dialog: This is a stock exchange, there's
dialog: no money you can steal -
text: He dries up as Bane stops. Turns to him...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: Why else would you people be here?
text: Bane grabs Trader 1 by the throat and drags him across the
text: floor to an online automated trades terminal... He puts the
text: man's thumb onto the print reader - the screen lights up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: Enter your password. Or I send
dialog: these men to your home.
dialog: 
text: Trader 1, terrified, types in his password. Outside, sirens.

speaker_heading: CONSTRUCTION WORKER

speaker_heading: FOLEY

speaker_heading: CATWOMAN

speaker_heading: CATWOMAN

speaker_heading: BATMAN

text: Catwoman looks at him. Considering.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Wayne wasn't kidding about a

speaker_heading: BATMAN

speaker_heading: CATWOMAN

speaker_heading: BATMAN

speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: I don't know. But Daggett seemed

speaker_heading: ALFRED

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: They don't have the tools to

speaker_heading: ALFRED

speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: ALFRED

speaker_heading: ALFRED

speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: ALFRED

speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: ALFRED

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: You'd abandon me?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: You see only one end to your story.
dialog: Leaving is all I have to make you

dialog: way. You used to talk about
dialog: finishing. About life beyond that

dialog:

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: She was, I can't change that -
speaker_heading: ALFRED

dialog: she'd chosen Harvey Dent over you?
text: Wayne watches, confused, as the old man prepares to say -
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: And what if, to spare you
dialog: pain...I'd burned that letter?
text: Wayne stares at Alfred, shocked.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Why would you say such a thing?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Because I have to make you
dialog: understand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: You're lying.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Because you are as precious to me
dialog: as you were to your own mother and
dialog: father and I swore to them that I
dialog: would protect you and I haven't.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: You're lying!

speaker_heading: ALFRED

speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: ALFRED

speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: No. I know what this means -
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: What does it mean, Alfred?!
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: It means your hatred. It means

dialog: might also mean saving your life.
dialog: And that is more important.

speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: This is it, isn't it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FOX
text: The reactor is beneath the river so
dialog: that it could be instantly flooded
text: in an event of a security breach.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Is Bruce Wayne really that
dialog: paranoid?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I'm gonna plead the fifth on that
dialog: one.
text: Miranda marvels as they step off the elevator. She spots a
text: figure deep within: Bruce Wayne.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I thought you might like to see
dialog: what your investment built.
dialog: 71.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: No radiation, no fossil fuels.
dialog: Free, clean energy for an entire
dialog: city.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: If it worked. It doesn't.
text: Wayne leads Miranda to the core. Two perpendicular rings of
text: electromagnets suspend a bowling-ball-sized mass of metal.
text: Wayne hits buttons - the ball glows, then dies to cold.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Ignition, yes. But no chain
dialog: reaction.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You've built a lot of security
text: around a damp squib.
dialog: Nothing.
dialog: About three years ago a Russian
dialog: scientist published a paper on
dialog: weaponized fusion reactions. One
dialog: week later your reactor started
dialog: developing problems... (Looks at
dialog: Wayne.) I think this machine works.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Miranda, if it were operational,
dialog: the danger to Gotham would be too
dialog: great.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Would it make you feel better to
dialog: know that the Russian scientist
dialog: died in a plane crash six months
dialog: ago?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Someone else will work out what Dr.
dialog: Pavel did. Someone else will figure
dialog: out how to turn this power source
dialog: into a nuclear weapon. I need you
dialog: to take control of Wayne
dialog: Enterprises and this reactor.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: And to do what with it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Nothing. Until we can find a way to
dialog: guarantee its safety.
dialog: 72.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: And if we can't?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Decommission it. Flood it.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Destroy the world's best chance for
dialog: a sustainable future?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: If the world's not ready. Yes.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Bruce, if you want to save the
dialog: world you have to start trusting
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I'm trusting you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Doesn't count. You have no choice.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I could've flooded this chamber any
dialog: time in the last three years. I'm
dialog: choosing to trust you, Miranda, and
dialog: that's not the easiest thing for
dialog: me. Please.
text: His eyes are genuine. Pleading. Miranda nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: We have a board meeting to get to.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BOARDROOM, WAYNE ENTERPRISES - DAY
dialog: 
text: The Board Members, including Daggett and Miranda, take their
text: seats. Fox at one end of the table, Wayne at the other.
speaker_heading: DAGGETT
dialog: I'd like to point out that we have
dialog: a non-board member here. Highly
dialog: irregular, even if it is his family
text: name above the door...
text: All eyes go to Wayne. An older member of the board pipes up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FREDERICKS
dialog: Bruce Wayne's family built this
speaker_heading: COMPANY -
dialog: 73.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOARD MEMBER 2
dialog: And he himself has run it -
speaker_heading: DAGGETT
dialog: Into the ground, sir. Anybody
dialog: disagree? Check the value of your
text: shares this morning. Gambling on
dialog: crazy futures didn't just lose Mr.
dialog: Wayne his seat, it's lost us all a
dialog: lot of money. He needs to leave.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I'm afraid he has a point, Mr.
dialog: Wayne.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I understand. Ladies and gentlemen.
dialog: 
text: Wayne glances at Miranda who nods at him. Wayne leaves.
speaker_heading: DAGGETT
dialog: Let's get down to business.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Right away.

scene_heading: INT. LOBBY, WAYNE ENTERPRISES - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: Wayne, how's it feel to be one of
dialog: the people?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMPANY VALET
dialog: I'm sorry, sir, they had paperwork
dialog: -
dialog: 
text: Wayne looks over to see his Lamborghini being towed.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (O.S.)
dialog: Looks like you need a lift.
text: Wayne turns to see Blake standing by his patrol car. Nods.

scene_heading: INT. DAGGETT'S PENTHOUSE - DAY
text: Daggett bursts in, furious. Stryver tries to placate him.
speaker_heading: DAGGETT
dialog: How the hell did Miranda Tate get
text: the inside track on the Wayne
dialog: board?! Was she meeting with Wayne?
dialog: Was she sleeping with Wayne?
speaker_heading: STRYVER
dialog: Not that we know of -
speaker_heading: DAGGETT
dialog: Clearly you don't 'know of'
dialog: anything, do you?! Where's Bane?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STRYVER
dialog: We told him it was urgent -
speaker_heading: DAGGETT
dialog: Then where is the masked -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANE (O.S.)
dialog: Speak of the devil...
text: Daggett turns. Bane is already there.
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: ...and he shall appear.
speaker_heading: DAGGETT
dialog: What the hell's going on?
speaker_heading: BANE
text: The plan is proceeding as expected.
speaker_heading: DAGGETT
dialog: You see me running Wayne
dialog: Enterprises?! (Moves towards Bane.)
dialog: Your stock exchange hit didn't
dialog: work, friend. And now you've got my
dialog: construction crews working all
dialog: hours around the city? How's that
dialog: supposed to help my company absorb
dialog: Wayne's?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANE
speaker_heading: (TO STRYVER)
dialog: Leave us.
dialog: 75.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAGGETT
dialog: You stay right there! I'm in
dialog: charge!
text: Bane places a gentle hand on Daggett's shoulder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: Do you feel in charge?
text: Daggett is taken aback. Stryver leaves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAGGETT
dialog: I've paid you a small fortune -
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: And that gives you power over me?
dialog: 
text: Daggett considers the heavy hand on his shoulder. Nervous.
speaker_heading: DAGGETT
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: Your money and infrastructure have
dialog: been important. Till now.
speaker_heading: DAGGETT
dialog: What are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANE
text: Gotham's reckoning. Come to end the
dialog: borrowed time you've all been
dialog: living on...
dialog: 
text: Bane gently takes the terrified Daggett's head in his
dialog: hands...
speaker_heading: DAGGETT
dialog: You are true evil...

speaker_heading: BANE

scene_heading: INT./EXT. CRUISER ON GOTHAM STREETS - MOMENTS LATER
text: Wayne stares out the window. Blake glances across.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: When you began...why the mask?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: To protect the people closest to
dialog: me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: You're a loner with no family.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: There are always people you care
dialog: about. You just don't realize how
dialog: much until they're gone. (Collects
dialog: himself.) The idea was to be a
dialog: symbol. Batman could be anybody,
dialog: that was the point.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: It was damn good to see him back.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Not everybody agrees.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: They'll figure it out in the end.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Got anything on Bane's whereabouts?
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Yeah, I've got five hundred pages
text: of tunnel records and a flashlight.
dialog: I could use some help.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
speaker_heading: (THINKS)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: You got money?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: (smiles, sheepish)
dialog: Actually, no.
text: Blake hands him some bills, watches him cross the street.
text: The radio squawks. Blake reacts - drives off.

scene_heading: INT. SELINA'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
text: Selina is packing a bag. She hears voices in the stairwell.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEN (O.S.)

speaker_heading: WAYNE (O.S.)
dialog: I don't think so.

scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL OUTSIDE SELINA'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: Selina finds Wayne standing there with Jen.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: He's not a mark.
text: Jen looks at Selina. At Wayne.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: And he doesn't have a cent to his
dialog: name, anyway.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SELINA'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
text: Wayne looks at the cramped space. Selina shifts,
dialog: embarrassed.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Yeah, it's not much. (Smiles.) But
dialog: it's more that you've got right
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Actually, they're letting me keep
dialog: the house.

speaker_heading: SELINA
speaker_heading: (SHAKES HEAD)

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: (spots her bag)
dialog: Vacation?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Let's just say that I've incurred
dialog: the wrath of some people less
dialog: susceptible to my charms than you.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: My powerful friend hopes to change
dialog: your mind about leaving.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: And how would he do that?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: By giving you what you want.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: It doesn't exist.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
text: He says it does. He wants to meet.
dialog: Tonight.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
text: He needs to find Bane. He thinks
dialog: you'd know how.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Tell him I'll think about it.
text: Wayne nods, starts to leave.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Mr. Wayne? I'm sorry they took all

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Blake enters. Gordon is sitting up in bed, talking to Foley.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Can we help you, officer?
speaker_heading: BLAKE
text: John Daggett's body was found in a
dialog: dumpster an hour ago. I thought you
dialog: might like to know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Because Daggett's name is all over
dialog: the permits I pulled to map the
text: tunnels under Gotham.
text: Blake hands Gordon a stack of files. Foley glares at Blake.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: MTA maintenance, sewer
dialog: construction...
speaker_heading: GORDON
speaker_heading: (TO FOLEY)
dialog: Where did you get to with the
dialog: tunnel searches?
speaker_heading: FOLEY
speaker_heading: (TO BLAKE)
dialog: Remind me to tell the detail to
dialog: keep hotheads out. (To Gordon.)
dialog: We've had teams down there, but
dialog: it's a huge network -
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Get more men, work a grid. I want
dialog: him found.
speaker_heading: FOLEY
dialog: Yeah, yeah - the masked man. We're
text: on it.
dialog: 
text: Gordon eyes the files hungrily - glances up at Blake.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: This is good work. Lose the uniform
dialog: - you're working for me now. We
dialog: could use some hotter heads around
dialog: here.
dialog: 80.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: This could just be a coincidence.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: You're a detective now, son, you're

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WAYNE MANOR - EVENING (END OF DAY)
text: Wayne, covering his head with a newspaper, hurries up the

speaker_heading: MIRANDA (O.S)
text: Nobody's answering.
text: Wayne turns to find Miranda there.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: No. I'm on my own now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Do you have keys?
text: Wayne looks a little helpless all of a sudden.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Never needed them...
text: She takes his hand.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Let's find a window.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GREAT ROOM, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS (END OF DAY)
text: They force the French windows - enter, brushing off the
dialog: rain.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Fox worked the board like you've
dialog: never seen - I'm in, Daggett's out
text: and he's not happy.
text: Wayne sets down the newspaper:
text: FROM BILLIONAIRE TO BUM
dialog: 81.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Hope you don't like me for your
dialog: money.
text: Miranda kicks off her shoes. Glances at the paper.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
text: Suffering builds character.
text: Then at a photo of Wayne's parents.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I'll take care of your parents'
dialog: legacy, Bruce.
text: Miranda picks up a photo of Rachel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Who's this?
text: Wayne looks at her. Can't find words...
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Where's Alfred?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
text: He left. Taking everything.
text: Miranda puts the photo down. Kisses him. Passionately. Then
text: again. He kisses back. Suddenly the lights go out.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: What's that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
speaker_heading: (SHEEPISH)

dialog: 
text: Wayne watches as Miranda tends to a roaring fire.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: You're pretty good at that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: When I was a child we had almost
dialog: nothing. But on the nights we had a
dialog: fire, we felt very rich indeed.
text: She returns to him, pulling a blanket around both of them.
dialog: 82.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I assumed your family was wealthy.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Not always. Not when I was young.
dialog: 
text: He traces a scar on her shoulder.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: An old mistake.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I've made a few myself.
text: She turns to him, tracing the scars across his chest.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: More than a few... (Smiles.) We
dialog: could leave. Tonight. Take my
dialog: plane. Go anywhere we wanted.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Someday perhaps. Not tonight.
text: She pulls him close. He kisses her. They fold into each
text: other, the warm heart at the center of a vast, cold room.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GREAT ROOM, WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT
text: Miranda is sleeping, wrapped in the blanket. Wayne studies

scene_heading: INT. BATCAVE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Wayne moves to the Batsuit. Picks up the cowl.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SKIES ABOVE GOTHAM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: CATWOMAN

dialog: 'Clean Slate'.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: That depends.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: On what?
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: On what you want it for. I acquired
dialog: it to keep it out of the wrong
dialog: hands.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Still don't trust me, huh? How can
dialog: we change that?
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Start by taking me to Bane.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
speaker_heading: (SHRUGS)
dialog: You asked.
text: Catwoman jumps down. Batman follows. Catwoman leads him down
text: into a service tunnel...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SERVICE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS
text: Catwoman speaks over her shoulder as she walks.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
text: From here, Bane's men patrol the

speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Neither am I.

scene_heading: INT. SEWER TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: CATWOMAN

speaker_heading: MERCENARY
speaker_heading: (SPINS)
dialog: Who?
text: Batman hangs upside down behind him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BATMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Me.
text: Darkness smashes onto the Mercenary. Gunfire in the tunnel.
text: Catwoman races along, pursued by a Mercenary. He is yanked
text: off his feet by darkness - he screams...
text: Batman picks off more and more Mercenaries. Screams echo...
text: Batman follows Catwoman through the dark tunnel.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Just a little further.
text: A grate slams down, separating them - the lights come on. He

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BANE'S LAIR, SEWERS - CONTINUOUS
text: Mercenaries look down on him from above. Catwoman turns.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN

speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: You've made a serious mistake.
speaker_heading: BANE (O.S.)
dialog: Not as serious as yours, I fear.
text: Batman turns. Bane emerges from behind the waterfalls.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Bane.
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: Let's not stand on ceremony here,

dialog: 
text: Catwoman hears the name. Less sure of what she's done.

text: his fist.
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: Peace has cost you strength.
dialog: Victory has defeated you.
dialog: 85.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Bane SMASHES Batman back - kicks him off the catwalk -
text: Batman drops, uses his cape to land. Bane climbs down on a
text: chain - his men watch in disciplined silence - Batman hurls
text: flashbangs at Bane, who doesn't flinch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: Theatricality and deception are
dialog: powerful agents...to the
text: uninitiated.
text: Batman lashes out at Bane - Bane counters - they separate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: But we are initiated, aren't we,
dialog: Bruce? The League of Shadows. And
dialog: you betrayed us...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Us? You were excommunicated. From a
text: gang of psychopaths.
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: Now I am the League of Shadows,
dialog: here to fulfill R¯'s al Gh¯l's
speaker_heading: A U
dialog: destiny...
text: Batman hurls himself at Bane, throwing him into the
text: waterfall, where he smashes his fists and gauntlets into
text: Bane's mask again and again, water cascading over them.
dialog: 
text: Bane is not moving. Just taking the blows. Batman pauses.
text: Bane's arms SHOOT OUT, SMASHING Batman aside - Bane RISES...
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: You fight like a younger man.
text: Nothing held back. No reserves.
dialog: Admirable. But mistaken.
text: Batman hits a switch on his belt - the lights go out - Bane
text: turns slowly addressing all the shadows at once.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: You think darkness is your ally.
dialog: But you merely adopted the dark. I
dialog: was born in it. Formed by it...
dialog: 
text: In the shadows, Batman circles, looking to strike...
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: I didn't see the light until I was
dialog: already a man. And by then it was
dialog: nothing to me but blinding...
dialog: 86.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Bane lunges backwards into the darkness - Batman's throat in
text: his grasp.
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: The shadows betray you, because
dialog: they belong to me...
dialog: 
text: Bane SMASHES him into the ground, POUNDING, pounding,
text: pounding the hard cowl with his bare fists until it CRACKS.
text: Bane RISES from Batman, gestures to the ceiling of the
text: chamber - explosive charges have been drilled into holes...
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: I will show you where I've made my
dialog: home while preparing to bring
dialog: justice. Then...I will break you.
dialog: 
text: A Mercenary tosses Bane a detonator - Batman watches through

text: Applied Sciences - Bane has dropped the bottom out of Fox's
text: weapons store...a camouflage Tumbler rests in the rubble.
speaker_heading: BATMAN

speaker_heading: BANE

speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: I wondered which would break first
dialog: - your spirit...
dialog: 
text: Batman SWINGS at him - misses - Bane GRABS him, lifts him
speaker_heading: HIGH.
dialog: ...or your body.
text: Bane brings Batman down onto his knee, BREAKING his back
text: with a horrific CRACK.
dialog: 87.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: In the shadows, Catwoman looks on. Shocked. Bane crouches to
text: pull the broken cowl off the broken Wayne. Mercenaries lift
text: Wayne's body and carry him off... Bane stares into the

dialog:

speaker_heading: SELINA

scene_heading: INT. JETWAY, AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER

scene_heading: INT. STONE CELL - DAWN
text: Wayne opens his eyes. Unshaven. Filthy. Someone else is in

text: at Wayne's bedside, muscled shoulders curving into his mask.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Why didn't you just kill me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANE

speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: BANE

text: Wayne's eyes dart about: filthy stone walls, distant

dialog: Where I learned the truth about
dialog: despair. As will you. (Rises.)
dialog: There is a reason that this prison
dialog: is the worst hell on earth...
text: Bane steps to the bars - looks up at a bright opening five
text: hundred feet above. Like being at the bottom of a gigantic
dialog: well...
dialog: Hope. Every man who has rotted here
dialog: over the centuries has looked up to
text: the light and imagined climbing to
dialog: freedom. So simple. So easy. And,
text: like shipwrecked men turning to sea
text: water from uncontrollable thirst,
dialog: many have died trying. I learned
dialog: that there can be no true despair
dialog: without hope. (Turns to Wayne.) So
dialog: as I terrorize Gotham, I will feed
dialog: its people hope to poison their
dialog: souls. I will let them believe they
dialog: can survive so that you can watch
text: them clamber over each other to
dialog: stay in the sun...
text: Bane points to an old TV, just outside the bars.
dialog: You will watch as I torture an
dialog: entire city to cause you pain you
dialog: thought you could never feel again.
dialog: Then, when you have truly
dialog: understood the depths of your
dialog: failure, we will fulfill R¯'s al
dialog: A
dialog: Gh¯l's destiny. We will destroy
speaker_heading: U
dialog: Gotham. And when it is done...when

speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: I was up here looking for a vantage
dialog: point. Found the people who run the
dialog: corporation who owns it living
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN JONES
dialog: Which corporation?
speaker_heading: FOX (O.S.)
dialog: Wayne Enterprises.
text: Lucius Fox is there, with Miranda Tate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Captain, meet Mr. Fox. Mr. Fox, I'd
dialog: like you to brief the Captain.
text: Captain Jones indicates Miranda.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Miss Tate is fully aware of the
dialog: situation.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: And as CEO of Wayne Enterprises, I
dialog: have to take responsibility for it.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN JONES
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Because, Captain, we built it.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN JONES
dialog: You built the bomb?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FOX
text: It was built as a fusion reactor.
dialog: The first of its kind. Bane turned
text: the core into a bomb, then
text: disconnected it from the reactor.
dialog: 123.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: And here's the important part.
speaker_heading: FOX
text: As the device's fuel cells decay,
dialog: it's becoming increasingly
dialog: unstable...until the point of
text: detonation.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
text: The bomb's a time bomb.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: And it will go off. In twenty-three
dialog: days.
text: Captain Jones reels at this news.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Bane's revolution is a sham. He's
text: watching Gotham rearrange its
text: deckchairs while the whole ship's
dialog: going down. Your appeasement plan
dialog: might not be as practical as you
dialog: thought.
text: Captain Jones throws Blake a look. Addresses Fox.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN JONES
dialog: Could you disarm it?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I don't know, But I could reconnect
dialog: it to the reactor. Stabilize it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN JONES
dialog: We'd have to let the Pentagon know.
speaker_heading: SPECIAL FORCES 2
dialog: They'll be monitoring our
speaker_heading: FREQUENCIES -
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN JONES
dialog: We have no choice. Let's move away

dialog: in.

scene_heading: INT. TELLSONS BANK - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: MERCERNARY

scene_heading: INT. TELLSONS BANK - CONTINUOUS

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN JONES

speaker_heading: BANE

speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: BLIND PRISONER

speaker_heading: WAYNE

scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND PRISON - DAY

text: He FIGHTS the rock face...breathing hard. Grabs at a rock -
text: it comes away in his hand. He DROPS - SMASHES into the rock
text: face. The Blind Prisoner shakes his head.
text: A Skinny Prisoner playing cards with the Prisoner looks up
text: at Wayne, hanging upside down.
speaker_heading: SKINNY PRISONER
dialog: Shouldn't you get him down?

scene_heading: INT. CAVE PRISON - NIGHT
text: Wayne wakes with a start - the Blind Prisoner is there.
speaker_heading: BLIND PRISONER
speaker_heading: (CRACKED ENGLISH)
dialog: You do not fear death. You think
dialog: this makes you strong. This makes
dialog: you weak.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BLIND PRISONER
dialog: How can you move faster then
dialog: possible? Fight longer than
dialog: possible? If not from the most
dialog: powerful impulse of the spirit. The
dialog: fear of death. The will to survive.
text: Wayne gets up onto his elbow. Looks at the Blind Prisoner.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I do fear death. I fear dying in
dialog: here while my city burns with no
dialog: one there to save it.
speaker_heading: BLIND PRISONER
dialog: Then make the climb.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: BLIND PRISONER
text: As the child did. Without the rope.

speaker_heading: PRISONER
dialog: Supplies for your journey?
text: Prisoners nearby laugh. Wayne moves to the cliff face. The
text: Prisoner follows, intrigued by Wayne's new demeanor. The
text: Tattooed Prisoner offers him the rope. Wayne refuses. Starts
text: to climb. Prisoners gather around as word spreads. Wayne
text: makes his way cautiously up the treacherous rock face. Down
text: below the Prisoners start a low chant.
text: As Wayne hoists himself up onto the precipice something
text: EXPLODES from the cliff face. Wayne flinches - BATS... They

text: Wayne closes his eyes. The chant RISES. Wayne takes a

text: again...then he jumps.
dialog:

scene_heading: EXT. CAVE PRISON, NEAR A FORTRESS - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: CRANE

speaker_heading: STRYVER

speaker_heading: CRANE

speaker_heading: GORDON

speaker_heading: FOLEY

speaker_heading: GORDON

speaker_heading: FOLEY

speaker_heading: GORDON

speaker_heading: GORDON

speaker_heading: SELINA

speaker_heading: WAYNE

dialog: But I still think there's more to

speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Start fresh? I can't even get off
dialog: this island.

speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: SELINA

speaker_heading: BLAKE

speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: If you're working alone, wear a

speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: No one cares who I am.
speaker_heading: BATMAN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Huh. And you always seem to know

dialog: that?
speaker_heading: BATMAN

speaker_heading: BATMAN

speaker_heading: BATMAN

speaker_heading: BATMAN

speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: What're you doing?
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Two minutes. I can fly it out over
dialog: the bay...
dialog: 
text: Catwoman is at his side as he works.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
text: Rig it out to fly over the water,
dialog: then bail -

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: No autopilot.
text: She takes this in. He stands to face her.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: You could've gone anywhere. Been
dialog: anything. But you came back here.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: So did you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: I guess we're both suckers.
text: She puts her arms around his neck. Kisses him. Batman moves
text: to the Bat, Gordon alongside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: So this is the part where you
dialog: vanish, only this time you don't
dialog: come back?

speaker_heading: BLAKE

speaker_heading: FATHER REILLY
dialog: It's an atom bomb -!

speaker_heading: BLAKE

speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: I never cared who you were -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: And you were right.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: But shouldn't the people know the
dialog: hero who saved them?
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: A hero can be anyone. That was
dialog: always the point.
dialog: 
text: Batman sits into the cockpit, then looks again at Gordon.
text: Anyone. A man doing something as
dialog: simple and reassuring as putting a
text: coat around a little boy's
dialog: shoulders to let him know that the
dialog: world hadn't ended...
text: The canopy closes - and as the Bat fires up Gordon remembers
dialog: -
text: INSERT CUT: Gordon, in his uniform, wraps the overcoat
text: around the Young Bruce's shoulders, his eyes reassuring,
dialog: loving.
text: Gordon looks up to the cockpit -
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Bruce Wayne?
text: - but is dusted by downdraft as the Bat RISES. Gordon LEAPS
text: out of the way as the core is dragged along and out of the
text: tunnel mouth.
dialog: 
text: The Bat struggles with the weight of the smoking core... A
text: building is in the way - Batman fights the controls but
dialog: there's no power to get over it.

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: FATHER REILLY
dialog: Blake, they need to make their

text: Blake turns to him, furious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: They're children! They have no
dialog: peace to make -
text: An EXPLOSION from downtown Gotham. Blake looks across,
text: startled, turns to the children on the bus.
dialog: Get down! This is it!
text: The smallest of the boys stares through the window past
dialog: Blake.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LITTLE BOY
dialog: No. That's Batman!
text: Blake turns to see the Bat thundering out of the heart of
text: Gotham, trailing smoke, the core hanging from it. It curves
text: dangerously close to the bridge before heading for the mouth
dialog: of the river...the bay...the ocean...
text: Until a point of light fires into an enormous nuclear BLAST
text: - wind and light and dust blowing VIOLENTLY but harmlessly
text: over the bridge, the tunnel mouth, all of Gotham...
dialog: 
text: As the nuclear dawn fades over Gotham, and we see its
text: inhabitants start to raise their heads, and helicopters and
text: boats converge on the island, we hear a voice. Jim Gordon.
speaker_heading: GORDON (V.O.)
dialog: 'I see a beautiful city and a

speaker_heading: GORDON

text: Gordon closes the book, looking down at Bruce Wayne's grave.
dialog: 'It is a far, far better rest that

dialog: 
text: Gordon looks up at the figure standing across from him...
text: Alfred. Tears streaming.
text: Fox places a gentle hand on Alfred's shoulder, then leaves.
text: Gordon and Blake follow. Alfred, alone with the Wayne
text: family, turns to the grave beside Bruce's - the grave of
dialog: Thomas and Martha Wayne.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I'm so sorry. I failed you. You

speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Can I change your mind about

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: No. What you said about structures.
dialog: About shackles. I can't take it.
dialog: The injustice. (Gestures at

speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Yup, here it is.
dialog:

speaker_heading: CLERK

scene_heading: EXT. MCU - NIGHT

speaker_heading: CREDITS.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: October 20, 1986
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. CITYSCAPE - NIGHT
text: The place is Gotham City. The time, 1987 -- once removed.
text: The city of Tomorrow: stark angles, creeping shadows,
text: dense, crowded, airless, a random tangle of steel and
text: concrete, self-generating, almost subterranean in its
text: aspect... as if hell had erupted through the sidewalks and
text: kept on growing. A dangling fat moon shines overhead, ready
dialog: to burst.
scene_heading: EXT. CATHEDRAL - NIGHT
text: Amid the chrome and glass sits a dark and ornate Gothic
text: anomaly: old City Cathedral, once grand, now abandoned --
text: long since boarded up and scheduled for demolition.
text: On the rooftop far above us, STONE GARGOYLES gaze down from
text: their shadowy, windswept perches, keeping monstrous watch
text: over the distant streets below, sightless guardians of the
text: Gotham night.
text: One of them is moving.
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - NIGHT
text: The pulsing heart of downtown Gotham, a neon nightmare of
text: big-city corruption, almost surreal in its oppressiveness.
text: Hookers wave to drug dealers. Street hustlers slap high-
text: fives with three-card monte dealers. They all seem to know
dialog: each other... with one conspicuous exception:
text: A TOURIST FAMILY, Mom, Dad, and little Jimmy, staring
text: straight ahead as they march in perfect lockstep down the
dialog: main drag. They've just come out of a bit show two blocks
text: over; the respectable theatre crowd has thinned out, and
text: now -- Playbills in hand -- they find themselves adrift in
text: the predatory traffic of Gotham's meanest street.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: For God's sake, Harold, can we
dialog: please just get a taxi??
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: I'm trying to get a --
dialog: (shouting)
speaker_heading: TAXI!!
text: Three cabs streak pass and disappear. MOM grimaces in
text: frustration as LITTLE JIMMY consults a subway map.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: We're going the wrong way.
text: Nearby, STREET TYPES are beginning to snicker. DAD surveys
text: them nervously, gestures toward the subway map.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Put that away. We'll look like
dialog: tourists.
text: TWO COPS lean on their patrol car outside an all-night
text: souvlaki stand, sipping coffee and chatting with a HOOKER.
text: The HOOKER smiles at JIMMY. JIMMY smiles back. MOM yanks
text: him off down the street and glowers at DAD.
speaker_heading: DAD (cont.)
dialog: We'll never get a cab here. Let's
text: cut over to Seventh.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Seventh is that way.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: I know where we are!
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: A deserted access street, sidewalks lined with the husks of
text: stripped-down cars. MOM, DAD, and JIMMY take a deep breath
text: and march down the darkened street. A VOICE startles them.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Hey, mister. Gimme a dollar?
text: The VOICE belongs to a DERELICT -- nineteen or twenty,
text: acne-scarred -- who sits between two garbage cans, his palm
text: uplifted. His ratty t-shirt reads: 'I LOVE GOTHAM CITY.'
text: MOM, DAD, and JIMMY pause for the merest of seconds, then
dialog: move on -- pretending not to hear.
speaker_heading: DERELICT
dialog: Mister. How about it. One dollar?
dialog: (standing up)
dialog: One dollar, man. Are you deaf?
dialog: Are you deaf? -- Do you speak
dialog: English??
text: By now the TOURISTS are halfway across the street.
text: Mercifully, the DERELICT doesn't seem to be following.
text: They pick up their pace. They don't see the SHADOWY FIGURE
text: in the alleyway. They don't see the GUN until a gloved hand
text: brings it down, butt-first, across the back of DAD's neck.
text: DAD crumples. MOM grabs JIMMY and backs up against a brick
text: wall, too terrified to scream. The DERELICT races across
text: the street to join his confederate, the STREET PUNK, who's
text: already searching for DAD's wallet.
text: MOM's mouth opens in panic. They can see she's about to
text: snap -- so the STREET PUNK, still in a crouch, trains his
text: gun on JIMMY.
speaker_heading: STREET PUNK
dialog: Do the kid a favor, lady. Don't
dialog: scream.
text: The poor woman is utterly horrified. TEARS stream down her
text: face. But she keeps her wits about her, stifles the urge to
text: shriek, and hustles JIMMY off down the street.
text: The two PUNKS watch them break into a run -- then chuckle,
text: slap hands, race off in the opposite direction.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT
text: Six stories up. The PUNKS -- NICK and EDDIE -- hunker down
text: on the tar-and-gravel roof, sizing up their take.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (emptying the wallet)
dialog: All right. The Gold Card.
dialog: (tossing the credit card
dialog: in EDDIE's face)
dialog: Don't leave home without it.
text: A chill wind whips across the roof as NICK extracts the
text: cash and begins to count it. There's a distant, indistinct
text: CLANG: metal on metal. EDDIE hears it and tenses up.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Let's beat it, man. I don't like
dialog: being up here.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What, scared of heights?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I dunno, man. After what happened to
dialog: Johnny Gobs --
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and
dialog: walked off a roof, all right? No big
dialog: loss.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: That ain't what I heard. That ain't
dialog: what I heard at all.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I heard the bat got him.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Gimme a break, will you? Shut up...
speaker_heading: EDDIE
text: Five stories, straight down. There
dialog: was no blood in the body.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No shit. It was all over the
dialog: pavement.
dialog: NICK has no patience with campfire tales -- but here on the
text: roof, in the pale moonlight, he can't ignore the slight
text: tingle at the base of his spine...
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: There was no blood, man.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: My brother says... all the bad things
dialog: you done... they come back and
dialog: haunt you...
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Listen to this. How old are you?
dialog: There ain't no bat.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: My brother's a priest, man.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No wonder you're such a chickenshit.
dialog: Now shut up.
dialog: (conclusively)
dialog: There ain't no bat.
text: As they speak our attention shifts to a point at the
text: opposite corner of the roof, some fifteen yards away...
text: where, at the end of a line, a STRANGE BLACK SILHOUETTE is
text: dropping slowly, implacably, into frame...
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You shouldn'ta turned the gun on
dialog: that kid, man. You shouldn'ta --
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Do you want this money or don't
dialog: you? Now shut up! Shut up --
text: BOTH PUNKS FREEZE at the sudden, inexplicable sound of
text: BOOTS CRUNCHING ON GRAVEL. They turn slowly. Their JAWS
speaker_heading: DROP.
text: Standing at the edge of the roof, bathed in moonlight, is a
text: BLACK APPARITION. IT DOES NOT MOVE.
text: EDDIE stands rooted to the spot, a choked gurgle in his
text: throat, as if he's just seen his own death. The BLACK
text: FIGURE advances, spreading its arms. Or rather, its WINGS:
text: GREAT BLACK BATWINGS, flapping in the wind.
text: NICK drops to the gravel, gropes for the gun, brings it up.
text: And still the BLACK FIGURE draws closer, deliberate,
text: menacing. On its chest: THE EMBLEM OF A BAT, in an oval
text: yellow field, glowing like a target in the darkness...
text: NICK FIRES TWICE. TWO CLEAN HITS. The strange black figure
text: is knocked bodily to the roof.
text: Trembling, sweating buckets, NICK gets to his feet. He
text: whacks a motionless EDDIE on the arm --
speaker_heading: NICK (cont.)
dialog: I'm gettin' outta here.
text: -- and bends to retrieve his loot. EDDIE lets out a
text: strange, pre-verbal squeal...
text: ... and NICK sees THE HUMAN BAT, BACK ON ITS FEET,
text: NIGHTMARISH, UNDEAD, MOVING SLOWLY AND INEVITABLY CLOSER.
text: Panic. Sheer, raw, unrelenting panic. Stolen money flutters
text: out of NICK's hands. He scuttles around the periphery of
text: the roof, his feet skidding on the gravel as he searches
text: for a way down. The BLACK SPECTRE is blocking his path to
text: the fire escape. Trapped like a rat, NICK FIRES WILDLY.
text: EDDIE is frozen in place, his eyes glazed over, his face
text: drained of blood. The BAT treads calmly past. A LEG snakes
text: out. A BLACK BOOT catches EDDIE high on the chest --
scene_heading: -- LIFTS HIM CLEANLY OFF HIS FEET --
text: -- AND SENDS HIM FLYING THROUGH THE AIR. EDDIE slams into a
text: brick chimney and slumps to the roof unconscious, a broken,
text: weightless puppet.
text: THIS ACTION IS SO SMOOTH, SO AUTOMATIC, THAT THE BAT DOES
text: NOT EVEN BREAK HIS STRIDE. NICK sees his chance and CHARGES
text: past the black wraith, scrambling toward the fire escape...
text: A GLOVED HAND slices through the air, and NICK pitches
text: forward, his legs ensnared in a tangle of WIRES. Screaming
text: now, he drags himself across the gravel roof, the looming
text: figure of the BAT at his heels...
text: ... until there's no place left to go. NICK cowers against
text: the ledge, his pants torn, his hands and knees bloody. He
text: has dissolved into total mindless hysteria.
text: Almost by reflex, NICK keeps shooting. He'd do better if he
text: could manage to open his eyes. By now the hammer is falling
text: on an empty chamber, but NICK continues, obsessively, to
text: pull the trigger. He weeps; he moans; he wails...
text: THE BAT grabs a fistful of NICK's shirt, and with
text: supernatural ease HOISTS HIM into the air.
speaker_heading: NICK (cont.)
dialog: Don't kill me... don't kill me...
text: When NICK finally opens his eyes, he realizes THE BAT is
text: standing on the ledge of the roof -- HOLDING HIM OUT, at
text: arm's length, over six stories of nothingness.
text: The gruesome black apparition speaks, in a rasping whisper:
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: I won't kill you. I want you to do
dialog: me a favor.
text: NICK looks down. Far, far below, CARS wink silently past.
text: He looks up. And sees, in the mirrored lenses where
text: BATMAN's eyes should be, the twin reflections of his own
text: stricken face.
speaker_heading: BATMAN (cont.)
dialog: Tell your friends. Tell all your
dialog: friends.
text: NICK HOWLS. Almost as an afterthought, THE BATMAN heaves
text: him roughly back onto the roof. And then -- casually,
text: without a moment's hesitation -- STEPS OFF THE LEDGE OF THE
scene_heading: ROOF, INTO MIDAIR.
text: Trembling, NICK crawls to the ledge and looks over...
text: finding ABSOLUTELY NO TRACE of the Batman.
text: NICK is still screaming as we PAN UP to the bilious yellow
text: globe of Gotham's moon. MAIN CREDITS ROLL:

dialog: Decent people shouldn't live here.
dialog: They'd be much happier someplace
dialog: else.
text: JACK NAPIER, 32, is right-hand man and chief enforcer to
text: Boss Carl Grissom. His features are delicate, almost
text: feminine, and he takes a vain, gangsterish pride in his
text: appearance. He is also absolutely merciless.
text: He trains a cold eye on DENT's televised image as ALICIA
text: HUNT -- 26, beautiful, Carl Grissom's kept woman -- glides
text: over in her negligee and snuggles up.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: Anything new?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: The usual gas. If this clown could
dialog: lay a hand on Grissom... I would've
dialog: had to kill him by now.
text: ALICIA finds JACK's necktie draped over a nearby chair. She
text: begins knotting it playfully about his neck.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: If Grissom knew about us... he
dialog: might kill you.
text: JACK seems uninterested in her affections. His eye darts
text: back and forth between the TV and his own reflection in a
text: nearby vanity.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Don't think so, angel. I'm too
dialog: valuable. That's the way I've
dialog: planned it.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: And besides, he doesn't know.
text: JACK checks his watch, reaches for his topcoat, and stands
text: in front of the vanity. He runs a hand through sculpted
text: hair, checks out his Albert Nipon ensemble.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: You look just fine, Jack.
text: He smiles at himself before turning to the door.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: ... I didn't ask.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT
text: The scene of the earlier mugging, a half-block off Gotham
text: Square. Only now, the deserted alleyway is a beehive of
text: activity: police cars, an ambulance, a forensics van.
text: EDDIE THE PUNK goes past on a stretcher, catatonic.
text: Watching him are a porcine cop, LT. ECKHARDT, and a POLICE
speaker_heading: MEDIC.
speaker_heading: MEDIC
dialog: That one there won't say a word. The
text: other one's raving his head off.
speaker_heading: ECKHARDT
dialog: Variety, huh? The spice of life.
text: At the mouth of the alley, we find ALEXANDER KNOX --
text: thirty, hyperactive, a crime reporter for the Gotham
text: Gazette. At the moment, he's chatting with a uniformed
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN.
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
text: They found him hugging a drainpipe.
text: He was scared to come off the roof.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Great, but tell me: is this another
dialog: you-know-what? 'Cause if so, it's
dialog: the third one this week.
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: (testily)
dialog: I dunno. What's "what"?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Good answer. I'm gonna put you in
dialog: for a commendation.
text: KNOX spots ECKHARDT and the MEDIC, waves cheerily, and
text: saunters down the alley. ECKHARDT curses under his breath.
speaker_heading: ECKHARDT
dialog: Oh Christ, it's Knox.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Hiya, gents. This anything I should
dialog: know about?
speaker_heading: ECKHARDT
text: Nothing out of the routine.
text: At this exact moment two uniformed PATROLMEN drag a brain-
text: fried NICK past the mouth of the alley.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: A bat, I tell you, a giant bat!
dialog: He wanted me to do him a favor...!
text: KNOX tilts one eyebrow. ECKHARDT and the MEDIC trade
text: disgusted looks.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: No offense, boys, but these guys are
text: seeing something up there.
speaker_heading: ECKHARDT
dialog: No comment. Print what you like.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Come on. One question. Is there a
dialog: six-foot bat in Gotham City?
text: KNOX's tone is jokey, but only half-jokey. ECKHARDT snorts
text: in disgust and turns away. KNOX shouts after him:
speaker_heading: KNOX (cont.)
dialog: If so, is he on the police payroll?
dialog: If so, what's he pulling down after
dialog: taxes?
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: We pick up LT. ECKHARDT as he emerges onto the side street.
text: He's headed for his car when he spies a STRETCH LIMO idling
text: across the street. Leaning on the hood, waving hi, is the
text: dandyish JACK NAPIER -- flanked by two impressive GOONS.
text: ECKHARDT throws a nervous glance back in KNOX's direction.
text: He turns left, gestures to JACK to meet him farther up the
text: block. By the time he reaches the corner JACK has swaggered
text: up alongside him.
text: ECKHARDT takes a fat brown envelope from JACK and stuffs it
text: quickly in his coat.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You didn't show up.
speaker_heading: ECKHARDT
dialog: We had another bat sighting.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm sure that was vitally important.
dialog: Listen: things are heating up.
dialog: Someone is leaking information to
dialog: Harvey Dent.
text: ECKHARDT bristles. There's no love lost between these two.
speaker_heading: ECKHARDT
dialog: I'm doing the best I can. If it's a
dialog: problem --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Eckhardt... our problems are your
dialog: problems.
speaker_heading: ECKHARDT
dialog: I'll work on it.
text: JACK reaches out and grabs ECKHARDT by the lapels of his
text: topcoat -- an Italian job, obviously expensive. He rubs the
text: material between his fingers.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Very nice, Lieutenant. But a little
text: ostentatious on a cop's salary,
dialog: don't you think?
speaker_heading: ECKHARDT
dialog: (knocking his hands away)
dialog: I answer to Grissom, punk. Not to
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You're a smart boy, Eckhardt. You
dialog: should be thinking about the future.
text: ECKHARDT laughs in his face.
speaker_heading: ECKHARDT
dialog: Ambition.
dialog: (nodding his head)
dialog: Forget it, Jack. You'll never run
dialog: that organization.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: And why's that?
speaker_heading: ECKHARDT
dialog: You're a psycho, friend. You're an
dialog: A-one crazy boy and Grissom knows
dialog: it.
text: JACK lashes out and BACKHANDS ECKHARDT across the face. The
text: fat cop, stunned, turns bright red and CHARGES JACK.
text: JACK claps a hand on ECKHARDT's face and shoves him back
text: full-force. The cop sprawls on his ass in the doorway of an
dialog: all-night Cuban-Chinese restaurant.
text: By now PATRONS are staring out of the restaurant windows.
text: ECKHARDT is livid. His hand goes instinctively to his gun.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Here. Use mine.
text: JACK pulls an automatic from his pocket and tosses it in
text: ECKHARDT's lap. He looks down and laughs, daring ECKHARDT
text: to pick it up -- just as the two enormous GOONS from the
text: stretch limo appear behind him for reinforcement.
text: ECKHARDT wipes blood from his mouth as JACK -- an A-one
text: crazy-boy grin on his face -- reaches down for the gun.
speaker_heading: JACK (cont.)
dialog: It's all right, boys. Lt. Eckhardt
dialog: here is a good cop. A real good cop.
dialog: (pause; smiling)
dialog: Inexpensive.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY
text: Gotham city's leading tabloid daily. COPY BOYS rush to and
text: fro; REPORTERS pound out articles on computer terminals.
text: ALEXANDER KNOX saunters in, a sheath of typed pages in his
text: hand, and pauses at a CARTOONIST's drawing table.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: What have you got for me, Jerry?
text: JERRY holds up a cartoon: a HUMAN BAT, with an awful,
text: fanged rodent's face, wearing a business suit. The caption
text: at the top reads: "HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN?" KNOX nods in
dialog: approval.
speaker_heading: KNOX (cont.)
dialog: Nice, but... maybe a little more gore
dialog: on the fangs, huh?
text: He pats JERRY on the shoulder, moves on. A BESPECTACLED
text: COLLEAGUE spots him and calls out:
speaker_heading: COLLEAGUE
dialog: Hey Knox, you got a visitor.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: I'm real busy, Clark. Be a pal and
dialog: dust him, okay?
speaker_heading: COLLEAGUE
dialog: This one you might want to dust
dialog: yourself.
text: Curiosity piqued, KNOX moves toward his desk... and stops
text: in his tracks. Propped up on the desk are a PAIR OF LEGS.
text: The legs -- exceptionally nice ones -- are attached to a
text: WOMAN leaning back in KNOX's swivel chair, taking a nap,
text: her face obscured by a big outrageous hat.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: ... Vicki Vale.
text: The hat tips back. VICKI VALE, her face framed by a shock
text: of bright red hair, flashes a dazzling smile. She pulls
text: KNOX over for a quick smooch and laughs.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: How'd you know it was me?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Honey -- I would know any randomly
dialog: selected square inch of Vicki
dialog: Vale.
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: If I had a good enough hint.
text: He points at the oversized CAMERA BAG on his desk. It bears
text: the monogram "V.V." VICKI catches on, makes a face at him.
speaker_heading: KNOX (cont.)
dialog: Where the hell have you been?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: A nice, restful vacation.
text: She reaches into the camera bag and pulls out a stack of
text: glossy 8x10's: COMBAT PHOTOS from some unspecified war-torn
text: corner of the world. KNOX leafs though them, impressed.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: God, a girl could get hurt doing
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I do get hurt.
text: She unbuttons her sleeve, rolls it back to show KNOX a long
text: fresh scar on the inside of her arm. He winces -- then
text: points to the scar and adds, slyly:
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Got any more of those?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Nothing I'm at liberty to reveal
dialog: here. What's new and hot in Gotham
dialog: City?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: It's too good, Vick. We got a six-
text: foot bat that swoops out of the
text: night and preys on evildoers.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Evildoers, huh? Big or small?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Small so far. I mean -- they don't
dialog: allow bats in boardrooms, do they.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Speaking of which... I hear the
text: notorious Bruce Wayne is throwing a
dialog: big do for the Harvey Dent campaign.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Yeah. Hottest ticket in town. Every
dialog: law'n'order freak in the city's
dialog: gonna be there.
text: KNOX suddenly freezes. It's just occurred to him that VICKI
dialog: may have a purpose in all this.
speaker_heading: KNOX (cont.)
dialog: Wa-a-it. Vicki. You're not saying --
text: She reaches back into her camera bag and hands over an
text: INVITATION. KNOX is all but panting with excitement.
speaker_heading: KNOX (cont.)
dialog: Aw, Vicki. Vicki!
dialog: (apprehensively)
dialog: Got a date?
text: She flutters her great big eyelashes, shakes her head no.
text: KNOX grabs her face and plants a kiss on her forehead,
text: nearly knocking her out of the swivel chair.
speaker_heading: KNOX (cont.)
dialog: Vicki, baby, I love you, I've always
dialog: loved you. Will you marry me?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: (straightening her clothes)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Well, I'm starving. Will you at
dialog: least buy me a hamburger?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Yes, but please -- be gentle.
text: Overwhelmed with glee, he offers her his arm.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE - DAY
text: A HUGE PLATE GLASS WINDOW opens on the best view in Gotham.
text: This spectacular penthouse suite is just one of the power
text: perks available to CARL GRISSOM, kingpin of the Gotham City
text: rackets, fat, fifty, and utterly without charm.
text: GRISSOM, behind a big broad desk, addresses his LIEUTENANTS
text: -- a fearsome assemblage of bloodless white-collar types
text: and few outright goons, sprawled in chairs throughout this
text: makeshift 'boardroom.' The big boss waves a copy of the
text: Gotham Globe -- with HARVEY DENT's face on the cover.
speaker_heading: GRISSOM
dialog: Nine points ahead in the new poll. I
dialog: don't like the way this is shaping
dialog: up.
text: JACK NAPIER slouches in an easy chair off to GRISSOM's
text: right, doing his trademark one-handed shuffle.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We can always pop him. -- Or pop
text: someone close to him.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT
dialog: Let's feed him to the bat.
text: This suggestion draws CHUCKLES from several members of the
text: crowd. GRISSOM is unamused.
speaker_heading: GRISSOM
dialog: He's going after our front
dialog: companies. Specifically Ace
dialog: Chemical. Which would tie us
dialog: in with Councilman Kane, Senator
text: Miller... on up the line.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: We have to clean out our files
text: before the subpoena comes down.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT
dialog: How do we go? The usual fire?
speaker_heading: GRISSOM
dialog: I'm thinking break-in. Trash the
dialog: office, remove the relevant
dialog: documents...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: "Industrial espionage."
speaker_heading: GRISSOM
dialog: That's right. And Jack --
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I'd like you to handle this
dialog: operation personally.
text: JACK has just turned up the third ace off the top of the
text: deck. His hand freezes in midair.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: ... Me?
text: At this exact moment, METAL DOORS slide back -- and ALICIA
text: HUNT steps out of GRISSOM's private penthouse elevator.
text: She's carrying a handful of SHOPPING BAGS.
speaker_heading: GRISSOM
dialog: Hello, sweetheart. I wonder if you'd
text: mind waiting in the other room.
text: ALICIA's gaze meets JACK's as she vanishes through a side
text: door. The eye contact is not lost on GRISSOM.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Why do you need me to handle a
dialog: simple break-in?
speaker_heading: GRISSOM
dialog: (emphatically)
dialog: Because I want someone I can
dialog: trust.
text: JACK bridles, but doesn't protest. Nervously, he turns the
text: fourth card off the top of the deck. It's not an ace.
text: It's a JOKER -- a Joker with a neat, round, .22 calibre
text: HOLE through its face.
speaker_heading: GRISSOM (cont.)
dialog: We'll work out the details later.
dialog: But it's got to be soon. -- All
dialog: right, that's all for now.
text: GRISSOM'S CRONIES get up to go. JACK, troubled, lingers
text: behind a moment.
speaker_heading: GRISSOM (cont.)
dialog: You don't mind, do you Jack? It's an
dialog: important job. I can't trust it to
dialog: somebody who'll screw up.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I understand.
speaker_heading: GRISSOM
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Jack. Don't forget your lucky deck.
text: JACK pockets the deck and leaves. GRISSOM sits behind the
text: big desk and GRINS WOLFISHLY.
speaker_heading: GRISSOM (cont.)
dialog: My friend, your luck is just about
dialog: to change.
text: He reaches for the phone. ALICIA appears in the doorway
text: nearby, modeling her new purchases for him. He smiles
text: coolly at her as he speaks into the receiver.
speaker_heading: GRISSOM (cont.)
dialog: Get me Lieutenant Eckhardt.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WAYNE MANOR - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT
text: A vast, rambling mansion on sixty wooded acres a half-
text: hour's drive from Gotham: old money, and how. Out front, a
text: team of red-jacketed VALETS are parking expensive cars.
scene_heading: INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT
text: A DEALER'S HAND pushes cards out of a shoe (the card kind,
dialog: not the Florsheim kind). It's casino night at Wayne Manor;
text: the ballroom has been outfitted with roulette wheels,
text: blackjack tables, etc., and the various members of Gotham's
text: power elite are happily -- and legally -- throwing money
text: into Harvey Dent's campaign kitty.
text: DENT himself is surrounded by a gang of political cronies,
text: telling jokes, calling in favors. VICKI's off in another
text: group, looking luscious, drawing compliments from big shots
text: and envious, furtive glances from their wives. And, in a
text: corner of the room, all alone in his cheap suit, stands
text: ALEXANDER KNOX -- staring inquisitively up at the ceiling.
text: A butler, ALFRED, appears alongside KNOX with a trayful of
text: champagne glasses. He too looks up at the ceiling.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: How high up would you say that is?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: You know, if you cut your bathroom
dialog: in half, you'd have my apartment.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Which bathroom is that, air?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: The small one.
text: KNOX takes a drink and ALFRED moves on. A moment later,
text: VICKI detaches herself from her little circle of admirers
text: and hooks up with KNOX.
speaker_heading: KNOX (cont.)
dialog: Man, I feel like Robin Leach. You
dialog: actually know all these people?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Some. I am a rich bitch, remember.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I'm quoting.
text: KNOX winces at the reminder. She smiles and takes his arm.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Yeah, I guess we move in different
dialog: circles. -- Though I did meet a
dialog: one-eyed pimp last week.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON JAMES W. GORDON
text: Gotham's Police Commissioner, a distinguished-looking gent
text: in his late fifties. He's at a craps table, blowing into
text: his fist. ONLOOKERS root him on as he lets the dice fly.
text: Snake eyes. Crapped out. GORDON passes the dice as KNOX and
text: VICKI wander up alongside him.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Commissioner Gordon! What do you
dialog: hear from our pointy-eared friend?
text: KNOX puts his hands up behind his head and wiggles his
text: fingers -- like little bat ears. GORDON groans.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Knox, for the ninth time, and you
dialog: can quote me -- there is no bat.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Aww, Commissioner. There's gotta be
text: one honest cop in Gotham city.
text: HARVEY DENT is working the room. He ambles up, claps a
text: friendly hand on GORDON's shoulder.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: How's your luck, Jim?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Mr. Dent. What's your stand on
dialog: winged vigilantes?
text: DENT exchanges a meaningful look with GORDON.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: Mr. Knox, I think we have enough

dialog: worrying about ghosts and goblins
dialog: and Halloween characters.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: My question is, where does one man
dialog: get all this junk.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: All over the world. They say he
dialog: spends most of the year overseas --
dialog: until recently, anyway.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Holy shit...

scene_heading: INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S LIBRARY - NIGHT
speaker_heading: KNOX (cont.)
dialog: ... We found the arsenal.
text: One wall is lined to the ceiling with leather-bound
text: volumes. On the other walls hang EXOTIC WEAPONS. Halberds.
text: Maces. Blowguns. Bolas. Thugee ropes and samurai swords...
dialog: every arcane implement of death the human mind has ever
text: devised. KNOX lets out a low whistle.
speaker_heading: KNOX (cont.)
dialog: This guy has just gotten
dialog: interesting. What else do you know?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Just what I've heard. Rich.
dialog: Reclusive. Old money and lots of it.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Likes to kill?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Women find him magnetic.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: I bet they like him for his big
dialog: charity balls.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: That, and the sweet smell of two
dialog: hundred million bucks.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Well, you know me. The more they've
dialog: got, the less they're worth.
dialog: (scanning the room)
dialog: This guy must be the most worthless
dialog: man in America.
text: Just then, A VOICE FROM BEHIND intrudes.
speaker_heading: BRUCE WAYNE
dialog: You disappoint me. Why not the
dialog: world?
text: KNOX turns. We get our first good look at the smiling face
text: of BRUCE WAYNE: 32, tall, athletic, impeccably mannered...
dialog: and intensely handsome.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: I assume in my usual charming manner
dialog: I've just insulted the host.
dialog: (extending a hand)
dialog: Alexander Knox.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Bruce Wayne. -- I've read your work.
dialog: I quite like it.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Great. Give me a grant.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I might consider it if you introduce
dialog: me to Miss Vale.
text: KNOX blinks at VICKI. BRUCE already seems to know who she
text: is. KNOX shrugs and forges bravely ahead:
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: "This is Miss Vale." -- That felt
dialog: redundant.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
speaker_heading: (to VICKI)
dialog: You're just back from Corto Maltese.
dialog: I saw your combat photos. Quite a
dialog: departure for you.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: That's intriguing. They haven't been
dialog: published yet.
text: BRUCE smiles and ignores the implied question.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: ... You have an extraordinary eye.
text: He's laying on the charm now. KNOX, his territorial
text: instincts aroused, pipes up:
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Some people think she has two.
text: VICKI shoots KNOX a sidelong glance:
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Don't mind my friend. He's a little
dialog: nervous tonight.
text: KNOX, chastened, calls off the dogs and sizes up his
dialog: competition. BRUCE is charming, all right, but there's
text: something formal, maybe even calculating about it -- he
dialog: could be reading his clever remarks off cue cards. It's
text: almost as though he's an actor doing a brilliant imitation
dialog: of charm.
text: This is a man who thinks three moves ahead. KNOX doesn't
text: like him. But VICKI -- who's used to seeing male charm
text: turned on and off, at will -- doesn't seem to mind at all:
speaker_heading: VICKI (cont.)
dialog: This is an amazing house. I'd love
dialog: to shoot it sometime.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I don't... seek publicity. -- Will
dialog: you be staying in Gotham for a
dialog: while?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: As far as I know.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Good. Then with any luck we'll run
dialog: into each other.
text: Suddenly ALFRED, the butler, appears in the doorway behind
text: them. He clears his throat. BRUCE turns.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Excuse me, sir. Commissioner Gordon
dialog: was compelled to leave -- very
dialog: unexpectedly. He asked me to convey
dialog: his regrets.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Thank you, Alfred.
speaker_heading: (to VICKI)
dialog: I hope you'll excuse me. It was a
dialog: great pleasure meeting you.
speaker_heading: (to KNOX)
dialog: And you.
text: Without bothering to shake hands BRUCE does a sharp 180 and
text: strides hurriedly out of the room.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: I know the rich are different, but
dialog: that guy is real different.
text: VICKI, staring off after BRUCE, doesn't seem to hear him.
speaker_heading: KNOX (cont.)
dialog: Hello? Vicki?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Oh. Sorry. I was thinking.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: What were you thinking?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Yum, yum.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Well, he must like the way he
dialog: looks. He's got a mirror in every
dialog: room.
text: And indeed, the two of them are standing before an enormous
text: WALL MIRROR, eight feet wide, running from floor to
dialog: ceiling.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I get it. Bruce Vain.
text: She pokes KNOX. He groans at the dumb pun. And suddenly we
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE - THROUGH THE MIRROR
text: looking DOWN ON KNOX and VICKI -- THROUGH ONE-WAY GLASS --
text: as they continue to chat. Behind the mirror... recording
text: everything that happens in the room... is a small, silent,
text: state-of-the-art SURVEILLANCE CAMERA.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - VIDEO MONITOR
text: showing KNOX and VICKI in the library. CAMERA PULLS BACK to
text: reveal that the screen we're watching is only one in a
text: whole vast bank of video monitors. From this control
dialog: center, we can see everything that's happening in the
dialog: house.
text: Now we ZERO IN on a single screen: GUESTS moving backward,
text: with exaggerated speed, as a videotape REWINDS.
text: At the panel, BRUCE WAYNE hits a button. And now we see
text: COMMISSIONER GORDON talking to a uniformed POLICEMAN.
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: ... anonymous tip. Tonight. The Ace
dialog: Chemical Company.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: (obviously agitated)
dialog: Good Lord, it we could put our hands
dialog: on Jack Napier... Why wasn't I told
dialog: about this? Who's in charge of
dialog: the --
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: Lt. Eckhardt, sir.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Eckhardt. Oh my God...
text: And suddenly COMMISSIONER GORDON is grabbing for his coat.
text: The monitor goes black. BRUCE reaches up, loosens his tie.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ACE CHEMICAL CO. - PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: UNMARKED POLICE CARS are pulling into the lot, headlights
text: off. ECKHARDT circulates among his ARMED SWAT TEAM, handing
text: out xeroxed copies of a PHOTOGRAPH.
text: The PHOTOGRAPH is a full-face shot of JACK NAPIER.
speaker_heading: ECKHARDT
dialog: Shoot to kill.
scene_heading: INT. ACE CHEMICAL - FILE ROOM - NIGHT
text: SPARKS FLY. A SAFECRACKER, in welder's mask, trains a
text: blowtorch on the office safe. Behind him, JACK'S HOODS are
text: at work on the filing cabinets.
text: The SAFECRACKER kills his blowtorch and opens the metal
text: door of the safe, giving JACK a good look at its contents:
speaker_heading: SAFECRACKER
dialog: ... Empty.
speaker_heading: HOOD I
dialog: Just like the file cabinets.
speaker_heading: HOOD II
dialog: I don't get it. If this place is
dialog: cleaned out already, what do we need
dialog: five men?
text: JACK shakes his head. His boys are antsy, ready to mutiny.
text: By now it's depressingly obvious: they've been set up.
text: Then, as if they needed any proof -- a SIREN blares
dialog: outside.
scene_heading: EXT. ACE CHEMICAL - NIGHT
text: ECKHARDT'S SWAT TEAM goes wide-eyed as a CONVOY OF POLICE
text: BLACK-AND-WHITES roars into the Ace parking lot. UNIFORMED
text: COPS pile out of their squad cars, relieving the SWAT TEAM.
text: ECKHARDT goes livid as COMMISSIONER GORDON approaches.
speaker_heading: ECKHARDT
dialog: What are you trying to do, blow the
dialog: collar?
speaker_heading: GORDON
speaker_heading: (to SWAT TEAM)
dialog: You men are dismissed. We'll take
dialog: over from here.
speaker_heading: (to UNIFORMED COPS)
dialog: Any man who opens fire on Jack
dialog: Napier... will answer to me.
text: ECKHARDT tries to slink off. GORDON grabs him roughly.
speaker_heading: GORDON (cont.)
dialog: You. Stick around.
scene_heading: INT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT
text: JACK and his HOODS ducking out of the office. It's two
text: stories above the refinery floor, accessible by a network
text: of steel ladders and CATWALKS running between the walls.
text: Down below, a CORRUGATED METAL DOOR begins to rise.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Freeze!
text: One hood goes into a crouch and OPENS FIRE. Half of his
text: colleagues dive back into the office, looking for a rear
text: exit. The others take off across the CATWALKS.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON GORDON
text: standing in the doorway as his MEN rush into the building
text: and take their places behind heavy machinery. SHOTS RING
text: OUT as the HOODS scatter.
speaker_heading: ECKHARDT
dialog: (snidely)
dialog: Nice work, Commissioner.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: I'm in charge here. Not Carl
dialog: Grissom.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT
text: TWO HOODS run down a tiled corridor in the office section
text: of the complex. They're almost at the end of the hall when
text: a CAPED BLACK SHADOW steps into their path.
text: It stands there, motionless. EXTENDS ITS ARMS -- like giant
text: WINGS -- revealing the yellow-and-black insigne on its
text: massive chest. BATMAN.
text: One millisecond later, the shocked HOODS are racing back in
text: the opposite direction.
text: THE BATMAN flings a handful of STEEL BALL-BEARINGS across
text: the tiled floor. HOOD I tumbles to the floor and lands
text: hard, losing his breath. HOOD II rolls and pulls a GUN.
text: BATMAN hurls a BOOMERANG -- its edges scalloped, like a
text: bat's wing. HOOD II finds his gun hand PINNED TO THE WALL
text: by the twin prongs of the BATARANG.
text: THE BATMAN strides briskly toward them, businesslike,
text: taking his time. He grabs a handful of HOOD I's hair, lifts
text: his head off the floor, KNEES HIM IN THE FACE.
text: He turns to the petrified HOOD II. CHROME-STEEL TALONS
text: spring out of his fingertips. He strolls past HOOD II,
text: reaching out casually to give him a QUICK NICK on the chin.
text: HOOD II slumps against the wall, unconscious.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON JACK
text: down on the floor, racing along a wall, THROWING SWITCHES
dialog: -- anything to create a diversion. With every switch he
text: throws, ANOTHER GIGANTIC MACHINE roars to life. CENTRIFUGES
text: SPIN. HUGE POLYMER EXTRUDERS spit out thick strands of
text: plastic gunk. OVERHEAD CHEMICAL TANKS rotate into place
text: over giant basins.
text: JACK SEES a squad of COPS on his tail, moving from machine
text: to machine, keeping covered. He SHOOTS AND RUNS.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON CATWALKS
text: BLASTING AWAY, HOODS III and IV scuttle across the elevated
text: walkways, keeping down, avoiding police fire. One of them
text: starts up a vertical ladder leading to the next catwalk up.
text: BATMAN plunges past on the end of a rope. A BLACK-GLOVED
text: HAND snatches at HOOD III's collar as he climbs and YANKS
text: HIM CLEANLY OFF THE LADDER. They drop to the lower catwalk.
text: HOOD IV gapes. He LEVELS HIS GUN at BATMAN, who stands his
text: ground, holding onto the rails of the catwalk for support.
text: A bullet hits him squarely in the chest. He does not fall.
text: HOOD IV turns and scrambles. BATMAN goes to his belt for a
text: miniature SPEAR GUN. He points it at HOOD IV and FIRES...
text: planting a BARBED HOOK in the HOOD'S LEG.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON COPS
text: staring up in utter disbelief at the action on the catwalk.
speaker_heading: COP
speaker_heading: LOOK!
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: My God... it's him.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON CATWALK
text: HOOD III, on his feet now, charges BATMAN from behind.
text: BATMAN -- not even turning to face him -- DROPS HOOD III
text: with an ELBOW. Now he has a HOOD on either side.
text: He takes a STEEL BILLY CLUB from his belt, whips it once
text: through the air. It telescopes out into a FOUR-FOOT STAFF.
text: Like a drum majorette from hell, he WHIRLS THE STAFF as the
text: HOODS CONVERGE on him. HOOD III takes a debilitating JAB
text: UNDER THE JAW. BATMAN SPINS on his heels and SLAMS THE
text: STAFF into HOOD IV's BACK -- knocking him OFF THE CATWALK
text: to the factory floor forty feet below!
scene_heading: INT. ACE LOADING BAY - THAT MOMENT
text: JACK spots a possible out. He hits a button on the wall;
text: STEEL DOORS RISE to reveal ACE CARGO TRUCKS in the parking
text: lot outside. Beyond the trucks... AN ARMY OF COPS waiting
text: for JACK to make his move.
text: No go. He turns. Behind him, other cops -- the inside team
text: -- are rushing at him in full riot gear. JACK ducks behind
text: a forklift and darts into the adjacent room.
scene_heading: INT. CHEMICAL SUPPLY ROOM - A MOMENT LATER
text: JACK sprints through the room, firing FOUR SHOTS at the
text: metal CHEMICAL TANKS on the wall. TOXIC CHEMICALS gush out
text: onto the floor in streams. The streams run together...
text: begin to SMOKE and SIZZLE.
text: COPS RIGHT BEHIND HIM. JACK can't resist taking one last
text: pot-shot at a FIFTH CHEMICAL TANK.
text: AN EXPLOSION knocks him off his feet.
scene_heading: INT. FACTORY FLOOR - A MOMENT LATER
text: COPS LOOK ON IN PUZZLEMENT as a RIVER OF CHEMICALS courses
text: out into the main refinery. A second later, they go UP IN
text: FLAMES. A WALL OF FIRE bisects the factory floor.
text: JACK RACES ALONG behind the spreading wall of flame. The
text: cops can't see him now. He ducks behind a huge machine,
text: hits a switch -- and SLUICE GATES OPEN. CHEMICAL SLUDGE
text: begins to churn. A big HOLE IN THE WALL appears as a gate
dialog: opens on the East River. It's the waste dump!
text: Up on the catwalk, BATMAN has a perfect view of JACK. If
text: JACK can just sprint through the flames without getting
text: shot, he'll make it to the river. BATMAN hooks a rope to
text: his Batarang, FLINGS IT at a catwalk across the floor.
text: JACK bolts. BURSTS THROUGH the wall of fire. And just as he
dialog: does --
text: BATMAN leaps off the catwalk and swings down toward him!
text: His foot catches a THIRTY-FOOT ROLL of plastic, six feet in
text: diameter, one of several standing upright on the floor. The
text: plastic roll DROPS into JACK's path, BLOCKING HIS EXIT.
text: An instant later, BATMAN lands on top of JACK. Wraps an arm
text: around his throat and RAISES his free hand. DRUG-TIPPED
text: STEEL TALONS appear. But before he can paralyze JACK...
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: HOLD IT!
text: In all the ruckus, HOOD V has managed to circle back behind
text: the heavy machinery. Now he's got a GUN pointed DIRECTLY AT
scene_heading: COMMISSIONER GORDON'S HEAD.
speaker_heading: HOOD V
dialog: Let him go or I'll do it.
text: BATMAN releases JACK and stands back. JACK chuckles to
dialog: himself: what loyalty. Then, with plenty of time, he
text: strolls across the floor to a Jacob's ladder mounted on the
text: back wall... and BEGINS TO CLIMB toward the catwalks.
text: All action stops. BATMAN doesn't move. The COPS don't move.
text: HOOD V stands there sweating, his gun hand shaking as he
text: waits for JACK to climb safely out of shooting range.
text: ECKHARDT's pig-like eyes glisten. His hand drops to his
text: side. He's half-tempted to pull a gun and get the
dialog: Commissioner plugged.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON JACK
text: at a crouch, groping his way along the rail of the catwalk.
text: He reaches a paneled glass window propped open by a
text: supporting rod. It's a forty-foot drop to the swirling
text: black currents of the East River... and freedom.
text: He's about to climb out when his eye falls on a .38
text: AUTOMATIC -- which lies, abandoned, on the gridwork floor
text: of the catwalk mere yards away.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON FACTORY FLOOR
text: The HOOD, one arm around GORDON. With his gun at the
text: Commissioner's temple, he backs slowly toward the door.
speaker_heading: HOOD V
text: Nobody makes a move. We go out
dialog: clean.
speaker_heading: JACK'S VOICE
dialog: ECKHARDT!!
text: ALL EYES TURN to the catwalk overhead, where JACK stands
text: poised with the .38 in his fist. A SINGLE SHOT drops
text: ECKHARDT cleanly.
text: The moment's distraction is all BATMAN needs. He hurls a
text: NINJA WHEEL -- a small, ratcheted, razor-sharp disc -- at
text: the FOREARM of HOOD V. One jerk of a thin filament WIRE --
text: a sudden SHRIEK -- and GORDON IS FREE.
text: The THUG lurches forward. His GUN DROPS to the floor,
scene_heading: DISCHARGING ACCIDENTALLY.
text: AN UNGODLY HOWL OF PAIN echoes out from the catwalk above.
text: JACK REELS and STAGGERS, his hands CLUTCHING AT HIS CHEEKS.
text: BLOOD GUSHES from between his fingers.
text: JACK NAPIER HAS BEEN SHOT THROUGH THE FACE.
text: A YOUNG COP, unnerved by the sight of JACK's agonized
text: pirouette, draws his gun and OPENS FIRE.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: NO!!
text: But the bullet has caught JACK in the arm. He spins,
text: totters to the edge of the catwalk... and TOPPLES OVER. The
text: COPS look on helplessly as JACK plunges TWO STORIES DOWN
text: into a CATCH BASIN full of BUBBLING TOXIC WASTE, SCREAMING
text: ALL THE WAY.
speaker_heading: GORDON (cont.)
dialog: Goddammit, we had him. We --
text: And suddenly, with JACK out of the picture, all attention
text: focusses on THE BATMAN. COPS reach for their guns, circle
text: warily around him. Cornered now, he backs off slowly, HANDS
text: ON HIS BELT.
speaker_heading: GORDON (cont.)
dialog: Hold it right there, Mister.
text: THE BATMAN raises his hands in a gesture of surrender. Then
text: -- as the COPS advance -- he flicks TWO TINY CAPSULES onto
text: the factory floor.
text: A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT. COLORS BURST in a wild
text: pyrotechnic display. COPS stumble backwards, momentarily
text: dazzled, as a THICK WALL OF BLACK SMOKE conceals BATMAN
dialog: from view.
text: A TINY GRAPPLING HOOK rockets out of the dense curling
text: cloud and CATCHES on a catwalk overhead.
speaker_heading: COP
speaker_heading: LOOK!
text: The COPS are firing wildly into the smoke. But it's too
text: late. At the end of a cord, THE BLACK MAJESTIC FIGURE OF
text: THE BATMAN whips upward, rising out of the smoke like an
text: avenging angel -- and DISAPPEARING into the shadowy
text: heights, safely out of range.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: HOLD YOUR FIRE!
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: ... Who is this guy?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: I don't know, but he's one hell of a
dialog: showman.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ACE CHEMICAL CO. - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: A BLACK SHADOW scurries across the roof. From the
text: illuminated sign with its neon ace, WE PAN DOWN past the
text: chemical sluice to a SECOND ACE... a card from JACK's lucky
text: deck, pierced by a neat, round bullet hole, bobbing on the
text: oily surface of the foul, polluted river.
text: As deadly toxins gush forth, OTHER CARDS from the deck
text: swirl past: a nine. A deuce. A queen. And finally, a JOKER
scene_heading: -- SHOT CLEANLY THROUGH THE FACE.

text: jubilant KNOX. He's on the horn to COMMISSIONER GORDON.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Commissioner. Do us both a favor.
dialog: Don't tell me some lie you'll have
dialog: to retract later.
text: CLICK. KNOX grins, lowers the paper, finds himself looking
text: up at the smiling face of VICKI VALE.
speaker_heading: KNOX (cont.)
dialog: Vick! Looks like our friend the bat
dialog: is getting ambitious. -- Why the
dialog: dopey grin?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Guess who's got a date with Bruce
dialog: Wayne.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Bruce Wayne? Date? He called you up
dialog: and asked you for a date?... Shit.
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: HEY MIRANDA! C'MERE!
speaker_heading: (to VICKI)
dialog: I want you to pay close attention to
dialog: this. Miranda -- tell my friend here
dialog: what you told me about Bruce Wayne.
text: A SUPERANNUATED SOUTHERN BELLE toddles over. MIRANDA REITZ,
dialog: 60, is the society editor of the Globe.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You mean Mister One-Nighter?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Yeah. "Mister One-Nighter."
speaker_heading: (to VICKI)
dialog: Because that's the average length of
dialog: his relationships with women.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: The current record is almost two
dialog: weeks. That cover girl -- what's her
dialog: name? You must've shot her, Vicki --
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Tell her about the peanuts.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Peanuts?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Yeah. Peanuts. Which is how he goes
dialog: through women.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Like Planter's Peanuts.
text: VICKI is about to break out into helpless giggles.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Plain or roasted?
dialog: (standing up)
dialog: Alex, I'm very flattered that you've
dialog: gone out and done all this research.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Why?
dialog: (blushing suddenly)
dialog: Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter.
dialog: I'm curious. I do this for a living.
dialog: -- What'd you tell him?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I told him yes.
text: KNOX fumes. VICKI shakes her head and laughs. She takes
text: KNOX's face in her hands, plants a kiss on his forehead.
speaker_heading: VICKI (cont.)
dialog: You're awfully sweet to be
dialog: concerned, but it's really not
dialog: necessary. I'll call you, okay?
text: She exits. KNOX stands there looking poleaxed.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: ... What was that?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: That was one of the most gracious
dialog: fuck-yous it's ever been my pleasure
dialog: to watch. -- What a nice girl.

text: closer to the shore, we see a throng of SAILBOATS.
scene_heading: EXT. DECK - YACHT - DAY
text: BRUCE's forty-foot cabin cruiser, aptly christened "DIE
text: FLEIDERMAUS." BRUCE and VICKI are on the deck, in chairs,
text: soaking up sun, gazing off at the sailboats.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Do you sail?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Too much work. I'm not really the
dialog: physical type. -- Thank you, Alfred.
text: ALFRED has just appeared from belowdecks with a tray of
text: drinks for BRUCE and VICKI. VICKI watches as BRUCE reaches
text: for his glass. His forearm looks like a thin layer of skin
text: over braided telephone cables.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: You do a very convincing imitation.
dialog: (sipping her drink)
dialog: Mm, this is tasty. What's yours?
text: He smiles, slides the drink over toward her, gestures for
text: her to try a sip.
speaker_heading: VICKI (cont.)
dialog: ... Ginger ale?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
text: Two drinks and I start swinging from
text: the rooftops.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Tell me, Vicki. There's something
dialog: I'm very curious about. What took
dialog: you down to Corto Maltese?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: ... I guess I needed a change.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: You were one of the most successful
text: magazine photographers in the city.
dialog: Everyone wanted you.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Have you ever been to Corto Maltese?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Not since the shooting started.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: We went there once when I was
dialog: little. I played on the beach. And
dialog: at nights -- they had a band -- I
dialog: danced with my father on the hotel
dialog: patio.
dialog: (shrugging)
dialog: That was Corto Maltese. When the war
dialog: broke out I had to go back. And I
dialog: promised myself that this time... I
dialog: wouldn't look away.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What did you see?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: ... Terror.
text: The conversation is getting rather intense -- at both ends.
text: VICKI seems to have hit some weird chord within BRUCE.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: There's terror everywhere. Some
dialog: types are just more -- familiar
dialog: than others.
text: For a moment BRUCE seems to be drifting back into his
text: familiar 'preoccupied' mode. VICKI laughs apologetically.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to -- I
dialog: know it all seems a million miles
dialog: away, out here on the water, with
dialog: all this --
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Insulation?
text: VICKI is momentarily stuck for a reply. In some way she
text: can't quite grasp, he seems to be challenging her.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Bruce, really, when I say these
dialog: things I don't mean to criticize
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I think you see things very clearly.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I'm happy to talk about something
dialog: else. I don't want to be depressing.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Do you assume that if I know you
dialog: better I won't like you as much?
text: VICKI starts laughing. BRUCE is a notorious womanizer, but
text: if this is a come-on, it's like no come-on she's ever seen.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I'm sorry, Bruce, I have to ask. Are
dialog: you like this with the other women
dialog: you know? -- Because I just can't
dialog: seem to get a handle on this
dialog: conversation.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (taking her hand)
dialog: Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or...
dialog: ambiguous, I think you should put
dialog: the most flattering possible
dialog: interpretation on it. Because even
dialog: if it doesn't sound that way...
dialog: that's how I'll mean it.
dialog: Bingo. The guy's a chessplayer, but on the other hand he's
text: also rather touchingly, almost childishly, sincere. Before

text: the crowd -- drop-dead beauties in slinky gowns. Although
text: most eyes are fixed, reasonably enough, on the stage, DONNA
text: #1 is staring with undisguised envy at a PRIVATE BOX above
text: the orchestra seats. Her mouth twists in disgust.
text: She scans the crowd, finds her counterpart (DONNA #2) some
text: rows back, on the arm of a bald bigwig. DONNA #2 is wearing
text: a similar sour expression, staring up at the same box.
text: DONNA #3 is even less discreet than her comrades. She has

scene_heading: HER POV - THROUGH OPERA GLASSES - THE BOX
text: BRUCE and VICKI. He whispers in her ear. She smiles and

scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

text: of a back-alley abortionist, steps up with a scissors.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Well, Mr. Napier, let's see how we
dialog: did.
text: He begins to snip away. As the bandages come off, we get:
speaker_heading: JACK NAPIER'S POV
text: The last strands of gauze peel away. The DOCTOR stands

speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Mirror.

speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Mirror.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON DOCTOR
text: He clears his throat, reaches apprehensively for a hand
text: mirror, and passes it out of frame to JACK. Two beats.
text: Then, the sound of GLASS SHATTERING as the mirror drops to
dialog: the floor.
text: JACK begins to laugh. THE DOCTOR gets a little edgy.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: You understand the facial muscles
dialog: were completely severed --

text: The DOCTOR turns uneasily away, gestures apologetically at
text: his seedy equipment.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR (cont.)
dialog: -- you can see what I have to work
dialog: with here --
text: MORE LAUGHTER. The trembling DOCTOR covers his face with
text: one hand, whining now, not daring to look at JACK.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR (cont.)
dialog: I'm sure that with proper recon--
dialog: recon-- reconstructive surgery --
text: A DOOR SLAMS. JACK is gone. The grateful DOCTOR breathes a

scene_heading: EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - OVERHEAD ANGLE - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. GRISSOM'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
text: The spectacular Gotham skyline, seen through the plate-
text: glass window of GRISSOM's conference room. The doors to the
text: private elevator hiss open and JACK wanders in. He plops in
text: the big plush swivel chair behind GRISSOM's desk.
speaker_heading: GRISSOM (O.S.)
dialog: That you, sugar bumps?
text: GRISSOM waddles in unsuspectingly from the adjoining room.
text: He's fresh out of the shower, a towel wrapped around his
text: impressive girth. He's using a smaller towel to dry his
text: hair, and so it's a moment before he sees the bundled-up
text: figure at his desk.
speaker_heading: GRISSOM (cont.)
dialog: Who the hell are you?
speaker_heading: JACK
text: It's me. "Sugar Bumps."
speaker_heading: GRISSOM
dialog: (recognizing his voice)
dialog: Jack?
dialog: (advancing cautiously)
dialog: Thank God. I can't believe it's you.
dialog: I heard you'd been --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (standing up)
dialog: Is that what you "heard"?
text: JACK gestures him over to the empty chair. GRISSOM doesn't
text: move until he sees the GUN pointed at his belly.
speaker_heading: JACK (cont.)
dialog: YOU SET ME UP!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Over a girl. You must be insane!
text: GRISSOM surreptitiously reaches for a desk drawer.
speaker_heading: JACK (cont.)
dialog: Keep your hands on the desk.
speaker_heading: GRISSOM
dialog: Sooner or later you would've tried
dialog: to take me, Jack. You may get me
dialog: now, but your life won't be worth a
dialog: dime.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I've died once already. It wasn't so
dialog: bad. -- In fact I recommend it.
text: GRISSOM is beginning to panic now. It's obvious that JACK
text: is utterly, hopelessly deranged.
speaker_heading: GRISSOM
dialog: Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --
speaker_heading: JACK
text: JACK? JACK? DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK??
text: And now, for the first time, he flings away the hat. RIPS
text: THE MUFFLER from his face. And -- as GRISSOM gasps in shock
text: -- STANDS REVEALED in his full horrendous glory.
text: His flesh is bleached bone-white. His hair is a luminous
text: seaweed-green. And his cheeks are torn and puckered from
text: the bullet wound, TWISTING HIS MOUTH INTO A HIDEOUS,
scene_heading: PERPETUAL HARLEQUIN'S GRIN.
speaker_heading: JACK (cont.)
dialog: I'm not a Jack any more.
dialog: (pause; cackling)
dialog: You made me a Joker!
text: THE CACKLE BUILDS INTO FURIOUS, HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER.
text: GRISSOM, revulsed, terrified, pushes himself away from the
text: desk, back toward the window which overlooks the city.
speaker_heading: GRISSOM
dialog: Jack -- I'm warning you. WIPE THAT
text: LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: HA! That's the best part. I CAN'T!!
text: And with that JACK pulls the trigger. And fires. And fires
text: again until the CLIP IS EMPTY.
scene_heading: EXT. GRISSOM'S BUILDING - NIGHT
text: We TILT UP the chrome-and-glass facade of the skyscraper,
text: arriving finally at the TOP FLOOR: a PLATE GLASS WINDOW
text: spiderwebbed with cracks where Jack's bullets hit.
scene_heading: INT. GRISSOM'S PENTHOUSE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: The room is still dark. JACK -- or, as we'll know him from
text: this moment on, THE JOKER -- sits in GRISSOM's swivel
text: chair, staring out at the moon-drenched skyline.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: What a view. Our little city. It
dialog: always brings a smile to my face.
text: He reaches for a nearby glass of liquor and glances down at
text: GRISSOM -- who lies dead on the floor, the towel still
text: wrapped around him. THE JOKER laughs softly to himself.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: Guess it's my little city now.
dialog: Wonder what it'll look like when I

dialog: Real fine and pretty.

scene_heading: INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S BEDROOM - MORNING
text: The sun is just up, and VICKI finds herself alone in bed. A
text: SOFT, OFF-KEY BARITONE VOICE drifts out of the adjacent
text: bathroom: BRUCE in the shower, singing "Honeysuckle Rose."
text: She breaks into a huge smile and climbs out of bed. Somehow
text: she's wound up wearing BRUCE's ribbed formal shirt.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - A MOMENT LATER - MORNING
text: BRUCE in his opulent deco shower stall, still SINGING to
text: himself. VICKI sneaks up behind him, opens the door. He
text: instantly STOPS SINGING -- as if he's been hit by a brick.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I didn't mean to scare you. I just
dialog: had to come in here and see it that
dialog: was really you singing.
text: She smiles, teasing him. He doesn't respond. He acts as if
text: she's caught him doing something shameful -- exposed him.
speaker_heading: VICKI (cont.)
dialog: (singing)
dialog: "Don't buy sugar -- you just have to
dialog: touch my cup." Come on. "You're my
dialog: sugar --"
dialog: (no response from BRUCE)
dialog: Bruce, you are such a case.
text: BRUCE seems somehow unable to sing along. But be quickly
text: recovers his composure -- and forces a crooked, almost
text: childish smile.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I don't sing very well.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Then there's one thing in the world
dialog: you don't do very well. And I know
dialog: what it is. -- Now you'll have to
dialog: kill me.
text: He kisses her good morning, steps out and reaches for a

speaker_heading: VICKI (cont.)
dialog: Poor thing. You should stay off that
dialog: horse.

scene_heading: INT. GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY

text: It seems she and BRUCE are the talk of the town.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: (disgusted)
dialog: ...Peanut.
text: A COPY BOY approaches his desk with a MANILA FOLDER:
speaker_heading: COPY BOY
dialog: Here's that morgue file you wanted.
text: KNOX leans back in his chair. The file is labelled "BRUCE

scene_heading: WAYNE FOUNDATION TO FUND LOW-COST HOUSING. MILLIONAIRE
scene_heading: HEADS CHARITY DRIVE FOR GOTHAM HANDICAPPED. HURRICANE

speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Come on. Gimme some dirt!
text: Then he notices something odd. In the whole fat file of
text: clippings, there are no pictures of Bruce Wayne -- with two
dialog: partial exceptions.
text: One is a group shot, Bruce in the middle, waving at the
text: camera and blocking our view of his face. The other is an
text: ancient picture of a collegiate Bruce, stern-faced, hair
text: down to his collar. The caption reads "BRUCE WAYNE IN

speaker_heading: DOORMAN

speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: ... The rent? Paid?
scene_heading: INT. ALICIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Honey -- I'm home!
text: She pivots. Her eyes widen. She SHRIEKS.
text: Sitting cross-legged in an easy chair, a twisted grin on
text: his loathesome face, is THE JOKER. He's in a smoking jacket
text: and slippers, reading the paper, a dry martini at his side.
text: This grim parody of domesticity sends poor ALICIA into a

scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - DAY

text: They stare suspiciously at the head of the table.
speaker_heading: JOKER (O.S.)
dialog: So that's how it is, gents. Until
dialog: Grissom decides it's safe to come up
dialog: for air... I'm running the show.
text: Now we see what they see: THE JOKER, dressed rather
text: flamboyantly in a big slouch hat. His FACE is layered with
text: flesh-toned makeup, and his HAIR's been rinsed black.
text: Unfortunately, he can't conceal his ghoulish SMILE.
speaker_heading: GANG BOSS
dialog: So why don't we hear this from
dialog: Grissom?
speaker_heading: RACKETEER
dialog: I got something I'd like to know.
dialog: How come you're wearing that stupid
dialog: smirk?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: 'Cause I got an army, chum. And I
dialog: got Grissom's army. And this city

text: CARMINE ROTELLI, an especially oily mobster, speaks up:
speaker_heading: ROTELLI
dialog: I don't like taking orders, from

text: taking orders from Grissom's goon.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I've considered that possibility.
speaker_heading: ROTELLI
dialog: And what happens if we say no?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (chuckling)
dialog: Nobody wants a war, Carmine. If we
dialog: can't do business, we shake hands
dialog: and part friends.
speaker_heading: ROTELLI
dialog: That's it?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: That's it.
text: THE JOKER extends a hand. ROTELLI reaches out to shake it.
text: He doesn't see the JOY BUZZER concealed in the JOKER's
dialog: palm.
text: 40,000 VOLTS course through ROTELLI's body. He drops back
text: into his seat a blackened husk, SMOKE pouring out from his
text: sleeves and shirt collar.
text: The CRIMELORDS recoil in horror. Before they can make a
text: move, a squad of ARMED THUGS burst into the room.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: Looks like Carmine got a little hot
text: under the collar.
speaker_heading: CRIMELORD
dialog: ... You're insane!
text: The JOKER is a wee bit agitated. He removes the hat and
text: mops sweat from his brow, exposing a patch of CHALK-WHITE
text: FLESH -- to the great bewilderment of the ONLOOKERS.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: That's what they said about Lee
text: Iacocca. Now GET OUT OF HERE. -- And
dialog: THINK IT OVER!
text: The sickened CRIMINALS file out cautiously. That leaves THE

scene_heading: ADDRESSES THE STIFF:

scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM PARK - DAY

scene_heading: EXT. HALLIDAY PLAZA - DAY

speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: ... To tell you the truth, I'd just

speaker_heading: BRUCE

dialog: All coyness aside?
dialog: (long pause)
dialog: I wish I had more time to give you.
dialog: Every day I don't see you, I miss
dialog: you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Now. Are you going to waste this
dialog: lovely afternoon being all mad at
dialog: me?
dialog: All this, of course, is delivered with devastating

speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Okay, I'm a sucker. You sound so

scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE - ACROSS PLAZA - THAT MOMENT

scene_heading: ON BRUCE AND VICKI

speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: All street mimes should be executed.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: ... Looks like a convention.
text: And indeed, there are HALF A DOZEN STREET MIMES converging
text: on the center of the plaza.
text: RICORSO and co. approach the mirrored-glass entrance of a
text: skyscraper. In the lobby, A MIME -- who's been annoying the
text: passersby -- THROWS A BOLT, LOCKING THE DOORS from inside.
text: A BODYGUARD bangs on the glass. Nearby, ANOTHER MIME
text: reaches into a trash bin -- and pulls out a MACHINE GUN.
text: SUDDEN SCREAMS OF TERROR from the onlookers.
text: VICKI turns to BRUCE. Before she can get his name out, he's
text: HOISTED HER BODILY and THROWN HER behind a marble fountain.
speaker_heading: SERIES OF SHOTS
text: BRUCE'S EYES darting birdlike around the plaza -- INTERCUT
text: with the following POV SHOTS, ALL IN SLOW MOTION:
text: - TWO MIMES with machine guns. One of them lining PHILLY

text: the CROWD at bay;
text: - A WOMAN in the crowd fainting. A THIRD MIME gleefully
text: imitating her swoon, to no one's amusement;
text: - PHILLY and his goons, COWERING, hands in the air, as
text: OTHER MIMES cruelly mimic their terrified poses...
text: ... and suddenly BRUCE is RUNNING FRANTICALLY, looking for
text: a secluded spot, an alleyway, anything. No go. He's out in
text: the open, with onlookers everywhere. In his civvies, he's
text: just another citizen... TOTALLY IMPOTENT.
text: He darts around a corner, backs against a wall. WOMEN,
text: CHILDREN, GROWN MEN race past. No privacy. He's
text: practically quaking now, in the throes of some terrible
text: anxiety. He looks up at the sky overhead, terrified.

scene_heading: ANGLE ON PHILLY AND BODYGUARDS

speaker_heading: ANGLE ON BRUCE

text: A moment later, it's all over but the screaming. VICKI
text: emerges from the crowd and finds BRUCE slumped against the
text: wall, nearly catatonic. She moves to touch him.
text: As if by reflex he reaches out and GRABS HER BY THE ARMS --
text: with a grip so strong it could crush bone. She GASPS, looks
text: up -- and sees, in his traumatized EYES, a look so raw, so
text: desperate, that it virtually defies comprehension.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: BRUCE!!
text: He blinks rapidly. He relaxes his grip. Before VICKI's
text: eyes, he's changing... becoming the BRUCE she knows.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Oh my God... are you all right?
text: He reaches for her. Involuntarily, she steps back.
text: He sees her reaction and his face goes slack -- frightened,

dialog: More significantly: an old CONTRACT dating back to the mid-

text: unnatural, involuntary. VICKI, sensing that something is
text: terribly wrong, lays a hand on CLAIRE's arm.
text: The MODELS, now wearing HUGE SMILES, begin to TWITCH
text: SPASMODICALLY. TONY snaps away.
speaker_heading: TONY (cont.)
dialog: Yes! Oh baby, YES! That's --
dialog: (beat)
dialog: No! Too far, too far! Pull back,
dialog: pull back!
dialog: (dropping the camera)
dialog: OH MY GOD!
text: The SUPERMODELS PITCH TO THE FLOOR, shuddering
text: convulsively, their LIPS drawn back in FRIGHTFUL, FROZEN,
scene_heading: LAB-APE GRINS. VICKI GASPS. CLAIRE SCREAMS. TONY SCREAMS.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - EVENING
text: The Eyewitness News set, with anchors PATSY NARITA and
text: DAVE McELROY. Behind them, BLOWUPS of the two dead
text: SUPERMODELS.
speaker_heading: PATSY
dialog: The fashion world was stunned today
dialog: by the sudden deaths of top models
dialog: Kelly Brinkley and Christie Emberg.
dialog: Cause of death has been attributed
text: to a violent allergic reaction,
dialog: although authorities have not yet
dialog: ruled out the possibility of drug
dialog: use. Dave?
text: Behind DAVE, on the bluescreen: a HUGE STATUE, covered in
text: canvas -- not unlike New York's Statue of Liberty.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: In Gotham, plans continue for the
dialog: city's 300th birthday celebration.
dialog: The four-day event will conclude
text: with the unveiling, in Gotham
dialog: Harbor, of the newly restored 'Lady
dialog: Gotham'...
text: A TECHNICIAN'S HAND passes a slip of paper into frame.
speaker_heading: DAVE (cont.)
dialog: This bulletin just in. Nine more
dialog: mysterious deaths at a beauty parlor
dialog: in --
text: Off to the left, PATSY begins to LAUGH. DAVE FROWNS.
speaker_heading: DAVE (cont.)
dialog: Patsy! This is hardly the --
dialog: (his eyes widen)
dialog: PATSY!!
text: An offscreen CRASH. Suddenly DAVE is up out of his seat,
text: mouth agape in horror.
scene_heading: PATSY HAS GONE INTO CONVULSIONS. CAMERA WHIPS VIOLENTLY
text: RIGHT AND LEFT as she jerks out of her seat and TOTTERS
text: UNCONTROLLABLY across the set, LAUGHING INSANELY.
text: TECHNICIANS rush the soundstage in an unrehearsed frenzy.
text: PATSY spins like a dervish and LURCHES BACKWARD over the
text: newsdesk in a death spasm, giving us a quick look at the
text: grisly Joker's grin etched on her now-lifeless face.
text: DAVE gestures frantically to the cameraman:
speaker_heading: DAVE (cont.)
dialog: KILL THE CAMERA!! KILL THE --
text: Suddenly, CRACKLING VIDEO STATIC wipes out the screen. A
dialog: moment later, we're looking at:
scene_heading: SPLITSCREEN CLOSEUP - THE SUPERMODELS
text: Their gorgeous faces sprout BIG, ANIMATED-CARTOON GRINS as
text: a BOUNCY TUNE -- "Put on a Happy Face" -- comes up
dialog: underneath.
speaker_heading: MODELS (CARTOON VOICE)
dialog: ... Love that Joker!
scene_heading: INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY
text: THEME MUSIC CONTINUES as a grinning, deranged pitchman --
text: THE JOKER -- pushes his shopping cart down the aisle. The
text: shelves are filled with products bearing his TRADEMARK
text: HARLEQUIN'S FACE. He waves merrily in time to the music.
scene_heading: INT. STUDIO - VIDEO CONTROL BOOTH - THAT MOMENT
text: PANICKED TECHNICIANS swarm the booth. The studio feed has
text: been JAMMED. Every monitor shows THE JOKER'S COMMERCIAL.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: WHERE'S IT COMING FROM??
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: I DON'T KNOW!
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - THE JOKER
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: ... new improved Joker brand. With
dialog: the secret ingredient... SMYLENOL!
dialog: (a sweep of the hand)
dialog: Let's go to our blind taste test.
text: TIGHT ON an anonymous MAN -- GAGGED AND BLINDFOLDED, tied
text: to his chair, squirming, struggling. On the table before
text: him is a package labelled "BRAND X." A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE
text: reads: "NOT AN ACTOR."
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
text: Ooh. He's tense. Irritable. Out of
dialog: sorts.
dialog: (wagging a finger)
dialog: He's been using Brand X! But with
dialog: new improved Joker brand...
text: ANGLE WIDENS to include a BLINDFOLDED CORPSE, limp in his
text: chair, GRINNING HORRIFICALLY.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: ... it's a SMILE EVERY TIME!!
scene_heading: EXT. IDYLLIC PASTORAL SETTING - DAY
text: THE JOKER in a field of wheat. On a picnic blanket before
text: him are TWO CLEAN-CUT MODELS -- one male, one female, BOTH
text: DEAD... and GRIMACING HORRIBLY.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: -- and the world smiles with you!
dialog: Irresistable -- oh-so-kissable --
text: He grabs the dead MODELS by the hair. THEIR TEETH CLINK as
text: he forces their heads together for a post-mortem kiss.
speaker_heading: SERIES OF SHOTS
text: Television sets all over Gotham, as startled citizens react
text: to the JOKER's maniacal promo.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I know what you're saying. Where can
dialog: I buy these fine, fine products?
dialog: Well, that's the gag, folks, you
dialog: never know. Chances are... you've
dialog: bought 'em already!!!
text: As his RANT CONTINUES, we SEE:
text: - A YOUNG MAN watching the bedroom TV as he dresses for
text: a date. He's got an aerosol deodorant can poised under
text: one arm, ready to spray. He looks down at the can,
dialog: suddenly uncertain. Could it be...?
text: - A FAMILY in their kitchen, eyeing a 12-inch portable
text: as MOM serves dinner. They dig in automatically, then
text: FREEZE with their forks in midair.
text: - A MIDDLE-AGED MATRON at the living-room TV. Shocked,
text: she calls to her husband -- and gets no reply. We
text: FOLLOW HER to the bathroom door.
text: On the floor she sees AN OVERTURNED SHAMPOO BOTTLE.
text: Then: her HUSBAND, slumped down in the tub, a lethal
text: GRIN on his face. She lets out a SHRIEK.
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - STUDY - NIGHT
text: ALFRED THE BUTLER in a crouch, glued to the tube.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: ... Sir!
text: HIS POV: THE JOKER in tight closeup. Offscreen, an INFANT
text: begins to squall. THE JOKER cocks an eyebrow.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Baby's got a tummyache? Here's
dialog: something that'll fix him quick!
text: He tosses a JOKER PRODUCT out of frame. Then -- leering --
text: he gives the camera a BIG JUICY WINK.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: Now on your grocer's shelf. So
dialog: remember -- use Joker brand -- and
dialog: put on a happy face!!
text: MUSIC UP. VIDEO SNOW fills the screen as the jammed
text: transmission end. ALFRED looks over his shoulder.
text: TRACK IN ON THE GRIM, DETERMINED FACE OF BRUCE WAYNE.
speaker_heading: SERIES OF SHOTS
text: - The Gotham Globe cartwheeling into frame:
speaker_heading: PANIC GRIPS GOTHAM
dialog: Contaminated Products Claim 72 Lives
text: WHO IS THE MYSTERIOUS "JOKER"?
text: - An ANCHORWOMAN on the evening news. Her complexion is
text: curiously sallow. BLACK BAGS show under her eyes.
speaker_heading: ANCHORWOMAN
dialog: ... sixteen new deaths, with no clues
dialog: as to the Joker's identity or
dialog: demands. The list at potentially
dialog: lethal products now includes:
dialog: perfume -- mascara -- cold cream --
text: - The makeover counter at Bloomingdale's. SECURITY
text: GUARDS rush to the scene as THREE MATRONLY CUSTOMERS
text: go into simultaneous smiling fits.
text: - An ANCHORMAN with a BIG UGLY ZIT on his nose:
speaker_heading: ANCHORMAN
dialog: Men's cologne toothpaste mouthwash
dialog: -- underarm deodorant --
text: - A SUBWAY CAR jammed with STRAPHANGERS. HUGE PATCHES OF
text: SWEAT under every arm. The doors slide open; ONCOMING
text: PASSENGERS RECOIL VISIBLY at the unendurable stench.
text: - The original ANCHORWOMAN, whose look is now 100%
text: natural. Her hair is frizzy. Her eyebrows are missing
text: altogether. Every wrinkle on her face is plainly
text: visible.
speaker_heading: ANCHORWOMAN
dialog: Hair spray -- eyebrow pencil --
dialog: moisturizing cream --
text: - A LARGE DRUGSTORE. CASHIERS sit idly by the registers.
text: The store is utterly devoid of customers.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DUSK
text: From across the street we see VICKI headed down the
text: sidewalk toward a museum. A GLOVED HAND reaches for a pay
dialog: phone.
speaker_heading: VOICE
text: She's outside the Fluegelheim.
scene_heading: INT. ALICIA HUNT'S PENTHOUSE - THAT MOMENT
text: A BONE-WHITE HAND slams a phone receiver down. THE JOKER is
text: at his vanity. He's rinsed his hair black. He's applying
text: pounds of pancake makeup to his bleached face, his puckered
text: cheeks. In the right light he could almost pass for human.
text: In all the city, he's the only person still using
dialog: cosmetics.
text: A DREAMY, DRUGGED VOICE intrudes:
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: Jack? Who was that?
text: As he looks up at the mirror, we get a quick glimpse of
text: ALICIA behind him. The voice, the long blonde hair, are
text: unmistakable. But for some reason, ALICIA'S FACE is
text: COVERED... by a SHINY WHITE PORCELAIN DOLL'S MASK.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Get dressed. We're going out.
scene_heading: INT. FLUEGELHEIM MUSEUM - EVENING
text: A Gotham landmark, the Fluegelheim looks like something
dialog: Frank Lloyd Wright would've dreamed up -- a large open
text: atrium encircled by a stucco RAMP, which spirals up along
dialog: the interior walls to the CEILING four stories above. You
text: walk up this gently-inclined ramp to view the paintings.
scene_heading: INT. FLUEGELHEIM - ROOFTOP TEA ROOM - EVENING
text: The upper terminus of the ramp opens on an airy, fern-
text: filled dining room popular with tourists and elderly
text: matrons who work up an appetite looking at art. VICKI
text: enters, camera bag slung over one shoulder, portfolio in
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I'm meeting Mr. Wayne. Is he here?
speaker_heading: MAITRE D'
dialog: No, but your table is ready.
scene_heading: INT. TEA ROOM - TWENTY MINUTES LATER - EVENING
text: VICKI, sipping on a gin and tonic, checks her watch. A
text: WAITER brings her a small parcel, wrapped in brown paper,
text: bearing a single word: URGENT.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Miss Vale, this just arrived for
dialog: you.
text: As the WAITER leaves, she tears off the wrapper. Inside is
text: a small white box and a NOTE -- SCRIBBLED IN CRAYON.
speaker_heading: DEAR V. VALE,
text: PUT THIS ON RIGHT NOW.
text: Unsigned, of course. VICKI, puzzled, opens the box to find
text: a MINIATURE GAS MASK.
text: She hears a strange HISSING NOISE. A few feet away, GREEN
text: SMOKE is billowing out of an air-conditioning vent.
text: TRAYS OF FOOD CRASH TO THE FLOOR as WAITERS pass out. ART
text: LOVERS drop forks, go face down in their pasta salad.
text: VICKI hurriedly fits the gas mask over her nose and mouth.
text: Within seconds, she's the only one conscious in the room.
scene_heading: INT. MUSEUM - THAT MOMENT
text: GREEN SMOKE plumes up toward the ceiling as we TILT DOWN
text: toward the floor of the atrium. PATRONS and SECURITY GUARDS
text: lie sprawled on the floor, twisted at odd angles, out cold.
text: The mist is beginning to clear now. The doors swing open
text: and in strolls THE JOKER, looking quite dapper in his
text: street makeup and BIG PURPLE PIMP'S HAT.
text: A SQUAD OF GOONS enters behind him. Some of them are
text: carrying large cartons. They lock the entry doors, place a
text: "CLOSED" sign in front of them, and begin uncrating LARGE
text: CANS OF BLACK PAINT.
text: The JOKER steps up onto the ramp, examines the artwork with
text: an appreciative eye.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Okay, boys, let's broaden our minds.
text: He stops in front of an Ingres odalisque. Stands back a
text: pace or two to get a better look. Then pulls out a STRAIGHT
text: RAZOR and cuts a LONG DIAGONAL GASH in the canvas.
text: He ambles up the ramp, stepping over collapsed patrons,
text: pausing at every fourth or fifth painting. Monet water
text: lilies, a Degas ballerina -- all get the razor treatment.
text: Behind him his CRONIES work their way up the ramp, HEAVING
text: BLACK PAINT on every canvas the JOKER has missed.
text: He cocks an eyebrow at Edvard Munch's "THE SCREAM."
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: I kinda like this one. Leave it.
scene_heading: INT. TEA ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING
text: VICKI at her table, still wearing the gas mask, scared as
text: hell. The overhead lights wink out and the room goes dark.
text: The JOKER saunters over and pulls up a chair.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I think it's safe to take that off.
text: VICKI recognizes the deranged smile instantly. She removes
text: the gas mask, tries to gather her wits.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: You're quite beautiful.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: ... Thank you.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Unfortunate, but I think we can work
dialog: around it.
text: He sets a couple of CANDLESTICKS on the table and reaches
text: for his lighter. A LONG JET OF FLAME shoots out, Jerry
text: Lewis-style, as he lights the candles.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: You're Vicki Vale. I guess you know
dialog: who I am. -- Is this your
dialog: portfolio?
text: She nods. He opens it, begins leafing through the record of
text: VICKI's career. Newspaper photos from the Globe, at first.
text: Then fashion layouts, magazine covers of celebrities.
text: Artier B&amp;W shots from VICKI's first couple of exhibitions.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: Crap. Crap. Crap, crap, crap...
dialog: Ahhh. Now here's what caught my eye.
text: He's come to the COMBAT PHOTOS from Corto Maltese.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
text: The panic. The bloody skulls. The
dialog: armless screaming fellows... you
dialog: know, the atrocities.
dialog: (smirking)
dialog: Somehow, when you shoot it, it all
dialog: comes out so clean, so lovely.
text: VICKI is squirming, but she doesn't think it wise to debate
dialog: the point. Not with this lunatic, anyway.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: I guess I'm just an old cornball,
dialog: but... I live for beauty. I look
dialog: around at my little city, it gets me
dialog: down.
dialog: (indicating the photos)
dialog: We don't have anything like this.
dialog: Well, it came to me that what this
dialog: city needs... is beautification. Kind
text: of a big makeover.
dialog: (enraptured)
dialog: Miss Vale, I finally realized that
dialog: one man can make a difference. You
dialog: know the saying. "In his image...
dialog: created he them"?
text: VICKI gazes at the awful face of this deranged visionary,
text: getting more frightened by the minute.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: And you want a --
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: A visual record, yes. A before-and-
dialog: after kind of thing.
dialog: (leaning closer)
dialog: This could make your reputation.
text: Her first impulse is to get up and run. But she fights the
dialog: impulse. She won't run... not until she gets this maniac
text: on film. She reaches for her camera bag.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Maybe we should start with a
dialog: portrait of the artist. People might
dialog: like to see the face behind the
dialog: makeup.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: (momentarily puzzled)
dialog: ... Behind the makeup?
text: Then it sinks in. By candlelight, in the darkened
text: restaurant, with his pancake makeup and his black rinse
text: job, he looks practically normal. VICKI must think she's
dialog: looking at his real face!
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: Oh. Yes. I see what you mean.
text: He finds a pitcher, pours a glass of water, and very
text: carefully SETS IT ON THE TABLE in front of VICKI. Then --
text: suddenly, inexplicably -- HE BARKS AT HER:
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: Silly little TWIT -- I can't take
dialog: you ANYWHERE!
text: He sits back and grins expectantly. VICKI is thoroughly
text: nonplussed by this bizarre outburst. A moment passes.
text: He obviously wants her to do something, but she hasn't
text: got a clue as to what it is. Growing impatient now, he
scene_heading: POINTS at the WATER GLASS:
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: Well? What are you waiting for??
text: Now VICKI gets the point. She picks up the glass and HURLS
text: ITS CONTENTS in THE JOKER'S FACE.
text: His hands go up. He writhes. He shrieks -- like the Wicked
text: Witch of the West dissolving. He reaches for a napkin to
text: wipe his face clean... and begins to CACKLE.
text: His awful white-and-green clown's face revealed behind the
text: running makeup, he LEERS at her.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: You see, Miss Vale -- that was my
dialog: makeup.
dialog: (leaning forward)
dialog: What do you think?
text: VICKI is repulsed, but she's determined to tough it out.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I've seen worse. Much worse.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Strong stomach, huh? I like that in
dialog: a woman. -- Maybe we can do business
dialog: after all.
text: He seems to have calmed down a bit. It's almost as if he's
text: coming on to her. But just then, a tiny BELL sounds behind
text: them... and a VOICE intrudes:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Jack?
text: The JOKER turns. ALICIA steps out of a ROOFTOP ELEVATOR and
text: moves toward them, drugged, wraithlike. She's still wearing
text: the porcelain DOLL'S MASK we saw earlier.
speaker_heading: JOKER
speaker_heading: (to VICKI)
dialog: Christ, it's my girlfriend.
speaker_heading: (to ALICIA)
speaker_heading: WHAT?
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: You said I could look at the
dialog: pictures before you -- before you --
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Shucks, honey, I forgot.
text: (rolling his eyes at
speaker_heading: VICKI)
dialog: I'm in trouble now.
speaker_heading: (to ALICIA)
dialog: This is business, sweetie. Why don't
dialog: you go outside and see how the boys
dialog: are coming?
text: VICKI can't take her eyes off this strange figure drifting
text: eerily through the abandoned tea room.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: (hesitantly)
dialog: ... Why the mask?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Alicia! Come here, have a seat. Show
dialog: Miss Vale why you wear the mask.
text: ALICIA sits down numbly and begins to undo the mask.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: You see, Miss Vale, Alicia's beautiful.
text: One in a million. A work of art. In
dialog: fact...
text: We're looking at ALICIA's profile as the mask comes off.
dialog: The side that's turned to us is indeed beautiful. But the
text: side we can't see... SENDS VICKI RIGHT OVER THE EDGE.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: She makes you look sick.
text: VICKI lurches out of her seat, knocking it over, HER FACE
text: FROZEN IN HORROR. She finds her CAMERA, holds it out like a
text: weapon as THE JOKER advances on her.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: You SCUM! You SICK FILTH!... You DID
dialog: THAT to her!
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: What? I improved her a little...
text: VICKI backs away, snapping the shutter on her camera. HE
text: BLINKS as the flash gun goes off repeatedly.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I'll see you burn. I'll see you dead.
dialog: -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Miss Vale, was it something I said?
dialog: (brightly)
dialog: Do you want to sniff my flower?
text: There's a BRIGHT PURPLE BOUTONNIERE in his lapel. He holds
text: it up for VICKI's inspection as he moves menacingly closer.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: NO!
text: The JOKER squeezes a concealed BULB. A JET OF CLEAR LIQUID
text: spurts out of the FLOWER, NARROWLY MISSING VICKI.
text: She GASPS. BUMPS INTO A TABLE. ACRID BLACK SMOKE rises from
text: the floor where the clear liquid hit. Acid.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Come on, Miss Vale... STOP AND SMELL
dialog: THE ROSES!!
text: He backs VICKI into a corner. And then -- abruptly --
text: A SKYLIGHT SHATTERS IN A HAIL OF GLASS! A CAPED SHADOW
text: DROPS TO THE FLOOR OF THE RESTAURANT! And THE JOKER is face
dialog: to face with...
speaker_heading: THE BATMAN!
text: On his wrist is a STEEL GAUNTLET. Ha AIMS IT at the JOKER
text: like a weapon. Then PIVOTS SUDDENLY -- POINTS HIS ARM
scene_heading: THROUGH THE DOOR OF THE RESTAURANT --
text: -- AND FIRES A METAL SPIKE into the adobe wall of the RAMP
dialog: OUTSIDE!!
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: ... YOU!!
text: On the end of the spike is a CORD leading to BATMAN's belt.
text: In the wink of an eye he's GRABBED VICKI -- DRAGGED HER OUT
text: OF the tea room -- and PLUNGED OVER THE RAMP WALL, FOUR
text: STORIES STRAIGHT DOWN TO THE ATRIUM FLOOR BELOW!!!
text: The JOKER races to the edge of the ramp.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: GET 'EM!! GET 'EM!!
text: His GOONS are stationed at various points along the ramp,
text: still defacing masterpieces. They pull their guns and OPEN
text: FIRE as BATMAN and VICKI plummet past.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON BATMAN AND VICKI - AS THEY FALL
text: He holds the gauntlet overhead, ROPE whistling through it.
text: As we watch, the gauntlet sprouts STEEL WINGS -- forming a
text: BULLETPROOF SHIELD over their heads!
text: TWO FEET ABOVE the marble floor, THE ROPE jerks them up
text: short -- like a bunjee cord. GUNS BLAZE as BATMAN and VICKI
text: drop safely to earth and MAKE FOR THE EXIT.
text: The doors are LOCKED. BATMAN spots the black "CLOSED" sign
text: on a metal stand. He HEAVES IT through the glass doors.
text: VICKI hustles through. He points her to a side alley.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE ALLEY - THAT MOMENT - DUSK
text: VICKI rounds the corner just as BATMAN lobs a SMOKE PELLET
text: into the doorway of the Fluegelheim.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: GET IN THE CAR!
speaker_heading: VICKI
speaker_heading: WHICH CAR?
text: VICKI suddenly feels quite stupid. Because -- while there
text: are many cars parked along the side alley -- there is only
text: one BATMOBILE.
speaker_heading: VICKI (cont.)
dialog: ... Oh.
text: The BATMOBILE is sleek, futuristic, and... well,
text: indescribable. Imagine your own. VICKI climbs into the
text: passenger seat and is immediately dazzled by a stunning
text: array of electronic gadgetry.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Ignition!
text: As BATMAN sprints down the alley, a COMPUTER DISPLAY on the
text: dashboard registers his unique voiceprint. A tinny,
text: synthesized VOICE repeats the command:
speaker_heading: COMPUTER
dialog: Ignition.
text: The engines are revving up even as BATMAN vaults into the
text: cockpit alongside VICKI.
text: Guns in hand, the JOKER'S GOONS Are stumbling out of the
text: Fluegelheim, hacking, coughing, blinded by smoke. They DIVE
text: FOR THEIR LIVES as the BATMOBILE comes barrelling out of
text: the alley at ninety miles an hour.
text: THE JOKER emerges just as the BATMOBILE careens off.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I WANT HIM!! I WANT HIM!!
text: The JOKER climbs into the back of a van labelled "MONARCH
text: PLAYING CARDS." Half his GOONS pile into the van behind
text: him, the other half into a second car nearby.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS - THAT MOMENT
text: SIRENS HOWL as POLICE CARS converge on the Flugelheim.
scene_heading: INT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT
text: roaring out into CITY TRAFFIC.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Look! Police!
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: I called them.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Shouldn't we --
text: A POLICE CAR whizzes past the BATMOBILE. TIRES SKID. The
text: COP CAR does a quick 180 and sets out in hot pursuit of the
text: BATMOBILE. BATMAN FLOORS THE ACCELERATOR in response.
scene_heading: INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT
text: TIGHT ON the demented face of THE JOKER. A GOON calls out
text: from the front of the van.
speaker_heading: GOON
dialog: There they are! Dead ahead!
text: THE JOKER screams into a RADIO DISPATCHER'S MIKE.
speaker_heading: JOKER
text: ALL UNITS! SOUTHBOUND ON RIVERVIEW!
speaker_heading: SERIES OF SHOTS
text: The JOKER'S ARMY. THUGS in cars. CREEPS in Italian
text: restaurants. CROOKED COPS at a coffee shop. LIGHTS FLASH,
text: BEEPERS SOUND, and within seconds they're racing to the
text: streets, eager to join the chase.
scene_heading: SERIES OF SHOTS - THE STREETS
text: COP CARS. GOON CARS. THE BATMOBILE streaks through an
text: intersection, nearly causing a pileup. THE JOKER'S VAN
text: makes short work of a SABRETT'S HOT DOG STAND in its path.
scene_heading: INT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT
text: PEDESTRIANS GAWK as the sleek supercar RIPS UP THE
scene_heading: PAVEMENT.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: What about her? What about the girl?
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: He won't kill her.
dialog: (gritting his teeth)
speaker_heading: GODDAMMIT!
text: They're moving up on an EMPTY BLOCK -- a NIGHT CONSTRUCTION
text: TEAM. A HUGE PIECE OF HEAVY MACHINERY backs up slowly and
text: inexorably, BLOCKING THE INTERSECTION.
text: BATMAN GUNS THE ENGINE. SWERVES LEFT. TRIES TO SLIDE PAST.
text: And HITS THE BRAKES -- stopping inches short of a head-on
text: collision with a lamppost.
text: He jumps out of the car. No chance to get through. THE
text: JOKER'S VAN is two blocks back and coming up fast.
text: ONLOOKERS and CONSTRUCTION WORKERS are beginning to form a
text: crowd around them.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Can't we --
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Too many people. Come on!
text: (as she scrambles out)
dialog: SHIELDS!!
text: The BATMOBILE's computerized VOICE replies:
speaker_heading: COMPUTER
dialog: Shields.
text: With a series or CLANGS, CHROME-STEEL PLATES slide into
text: place -- across the cockpit, over the tires -- leaving the
text: BATMOBILE an inert, impenetrable BLOCK OF BLACK METAL.
text: BATMAN and VICKI sprint through the CONSTRUCTION SITE,
text: vaulting over mounds of loose dirt and concrete rubble.
scene_heading: INT. VAN - MOVING - NIGHT
text: THREE POLICE CARS, red lights blazing, OVERTAKE THE JOKER'S
text: VAN and bear down on the abandoned BATMOBILE.
speaker_heading: GOON AT WHEEL
dialog: Are they ours?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: ... I don't know. We'd better get out
dialog: of here.
speaker_heading: (into RADIO MIKE)
dialog: Westbound on 36th. DO YOU COPY??
text: The VAN does a discreet U-turn and rumbles off sedately
text: down the street.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: BATMAN and VICKI zigzag past storefronts and candy stands,
text: dodging astonished PEDESTRIANS.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT
text: FOUR GOONS with GUNS. They spot BATMAN and VICKI coming off
text: the side street. GOON I, the driver, speaks into a radio:
speaker_heading: GOON I
dialog: We got 'em!
speaker_heading: JOKER (V.O.)
dialog: (over radio)
dialog: Take 'em! I want his head!
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: BATMAN and VICKI race down the sidewalk. The car is gaining
text: on them; and then, from behind --
text: BATMAN and VICKI are caught in a SPRAY OF BULLETS. They
dialog: dive. Drop behind a parked car. And don't come up.
text: They've ducked into a BLIND ALLEY.
scene_heading: INT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT
text: Hunkered on the pavement, they watch the car glide past the
text: mouth of the alley. VICKI sighs in relief. BATMAN -- still
text: alert, his muscles tensed -- puts a restraining hand on her
text: arm. He looks overhead, sees a catwalk spanning the width
text: of the alleyway five stories up.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: How much do you weigh?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: ... A hundred and eight?
text: He does some quick mental calculations. A beat. Then the
text: CAR reappears -- backing up -- blocking their only avenue
text: of escape. BATMAN unfurls a rope, HEAVES A BATARANG UPWARD,
text: and grabs VICKI roughly about the waist.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
speaker_heading: HANG ON!
text: The JOKER'S THUGS pile out of the car. The BATARANG catches
text: on the catwalk, and BATMAN triggers the spring-action REEL
text: on his utility belt -- jerking him and VICKI INTO THE AIR.
text: BULLETS zing past as they whip upward like fish on a line.
dialog: One story; two stories; and then...
text: They slow. They STOP. They DANGLE IN MIDAIR as the Joker's
text: goons advance. BATMAN wriggles, twists. They lurch upward
text: another few feet -- and stop again. VICKI SCREAMS.
text: Her additional weight is too much for the reel mechanism. They're
text: stranded two stories up -- SITTING DUCKS.
speaker_heading: BATMAN (cont.)
dialog: Whatever happens -- DON'T LET GO!!
text: In the wink of an eye he's detached the reel from his own
text: waist and hitched it around VICKI's belt. Before she has a
text: chance to protest, he LETS GO.
text: VICKI rockets upward at blinding speed, shrieking all the
text: way. BATMAN, his cape billowing, PLUMMETS DOWNWARD.
text: VICKI slams up into the catwalk and BOBS on the end of the
text: line as BATMAN lands with a loud crash, overturning a row
text: of garbage cans. The GOONS are on him in a flash -- one per
text: limb. Random kicking and flailing. BATMAN manages to slam
text: two GOONS into a wall, but before he can get to his feet --
text: -- GOON #3 slams a lead pipe into the back of his skull.
text: BATMAN is down for the count. The THUGS dust themselves off
text: and circle around his prostrate form, still wary.
text: The LEAD THUG holds his colleagues back, draws his gun, and
text: fires TWO SHOTS, point-blank, at the yellow-and-black
text: INSIGNE on BATMAN's chest. The body jerks.
text: They move closer. And stop.
speaker_heading: GOON I
dialog: ... No blood.
speaker_heading: GOON II
dialog: Jesus.
speaker_heading: GOON III
dialog: Wait a minute.
text: GOON III screws up his courage and crouches beside the
text: body. He examines THE BATMAN'S TUNIC... and RIPS IT OPEN.
speaker_heading: GOON IV
dialog: ... What is that?
speaker_heading: GOON III
text: Some kind of body armor.
speaker_heading: GOON I
dialog: He's human after all. -- Take that
dialog: mask off.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - ON VICKI
text: Five stories overhead, VICKI has pulled herself up onto the
text: roof of the adjacent building. She watches transfixed as
text: the THUGS bend over to remove BATMAN's cowl. But at this
text: height -- and this angle -- she can't see his face. On a
text: sudden impulse she reaches for her CAMERA BAG.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON GOONS
text: peering-down open-mouthed at the unconscious face of BRUCE
text: WAYNE. Blood seeps from BRUCE's left nostril.
speaker_heading: GOON I
dialog: Well?... Who is this guy?
speaker_heading: GOON II
dialog: I dunno. You seen him before?
speaker_heading: GOON III
dialog: Maybe he's got some kind of I.D.
speaker_heading: GOON IV
dialog: Good idea. Let's check his wallet.
speaker_heading: GOON I
dialog: We'll worry about it later. Plug
dialog: him.
dialog: (beat)
text: In the head.
text: GOON II draws his automatic. And at that very instant... A
text: FLASH GUN EXPLODES OVERHEAD.
text: Startled, the THUGS look up. ANOTHER CAMERA FLASH.
speaker_heading: GOON III
dialog: Goddam, it's the redhead!
speaker_heading: ON VICKI
text: A chunk of ledge chips off mere inches from her head as the
text: GOONS OPEN FIRE. She ducks back behind the overhang, holds
text: the camera out over the ledge, and KEEPS ON FLASHING.
speaker_heading: ON BRUCE
text: HIS EYES WINK OPEN.
speaker_heading: ON VICKI
text: momentarily idle. She's used up her roll. The GOONS KEEP
text: SHOOTING as she reaches in her bag for new film. She finds
text: it, loads the camera with astonishing dexterity -- and
text: then, on instinct, reaches back inside the bag for a
text: TELEPHOTO LENS. All the better to see you with, Batman...
speaker_heading: ON THE THUGS
text: No response from VICKI. They begin to relax a little.
speaker_heading: GOON II
dialog: Did you hit her?
speaker_heading: GOON I
dialog: Who cares? Wax that freak.
text: They turn their attention to BRUCE. A GLOVED HAND snakes
text: out with lightning speed -- GRABBING GOON I BY THE COATTAIL
text: and pulling him DIRECTLY INTO THE LINE OF FIRE. GOON II bas
text: pulled the trigger twice before he knows what's happened.
text: In one fluid motion BRUCE HEAVES GOON I's lifeless body
text: THROUGH THE AIR, knocking GOON II backward over a garbage
text: can. GOON II falls and CRACKS HIS HEAD on the nearest wall.
text: GOON III takes a rabbit punch to the throat. He's on the
text: way down when he catches a STEEL-TOED BOOT in the gut.
text: Four seconds after all this began, BRUCE is alone in the
text: alleyway with GOON IV. GOON IV has his gun pointed right at
text: BRUCE, but he's shaking too much to pull the trigger.
text: BRUCE smiles. GOON IV SCREAMS and RUNS FOR HIS LIFE.
text: Through all this, VICKI's telephoto camera has been poised
text: on the ledge, snapping away. BRUCE looks up at the FLASH
text: GUN and shakes his head. He bends to retrieve his cowl.
speaker_heading: ON VICKI
text: She finally dares to peek down at the alley. Limp goons
text: everywhere. And, in addition, THE BATMAN -- leaping up,
text: grabbing the edge of a fire escape, climbing up to meet
dialog: her.
text: VICKI thinks fast. She may have a clean shot of BATMAN'S
text: FACE. She advances the film in the camera and removes the
text: roll, then drops it down her blouse.
text: But BATMAN is likely to want that roll. So she straightens
text: her skirt and scurries across the roof, away from the
text: alley. She should have a minute or so before be gets there.
text: It's a three-foot drop to the next roof over. VICKI
text: clambers down and quickens her pace, tossing a nervous
text: glance over her shoulder every couple of steps.
dialog: Then, somehow -- and she'll be damned if she can figure out
text: how -- she walks smack into THE BATMAN. And GASPS.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: ... Not even a 'thank you'?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Well -- I think you might consider
dialog: thanking me. You were good as
dialog: dead.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: That's because you lied about your
dialog: weight.
dialog: (a long pause)
dialog: Thank you.
text: VICKI NODS and tries to walk past him. He grabs her arm.
speaker_heading: BATMAN (cont.)
dialog: I'll have to ask you for that film.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I just wanted to distract them. I
dialog: wasn't trying to get a picture of
dialog: you.
text: BATMAN looks down at the camera hanging from her neck. The
text: telephoto lens must jut out six inches. VICKI gulps.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I won't let you have it.
text: THE BATMAN is amused. He smiles menacingly.
speaker_heading: VICKI (cont.)
dialog: I know you can break my neck and
dialog: take it. But the Joker's on that
dialog: same roll. I --
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: The Joker is a murderer. And you
dialog: were as good as dead. So --
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Look, I appreciate what you did for
dialog: me. But this is my job. And I'm
dialog: keeping those pictures.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: All right, here's a compromise. I'll
dialog: develop the photos. You keep the
dialog: Jokers and I'll keep the rest.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: How do I know you won't keep them
dialog: all?
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Because I'll take you with me.
text: He reaches out, holds her gently by the shoulders. His
text: voice is deep and soothing. True, VICKI is a little dizzy
text: from all that's happened, but she's undeniably drawn to
dialog: him.
text: Still cautious, though. She reaches into her bag and hands
text: over a roll of film. The original roll -- not the telephoto
text: shots, which are still stashed in her blouse.
speaker_heading: BATMAN (cont.)
dialog: Thank you, Vicki.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: ... Where are you going to take me?
text: No reply. She looks up into his mirrored eyes. He pulls her
text: closer to him. Brushes back her hair, runs one hand
text: delicately along the line of her cheek...
text: ... AND BREAKS A TINY CAPSULE under her nose. VICKI SLUMPS
text: into BATMAN's arms.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT
text: Street level. BATMAN emerges carrying VICKI's inert form in
text: his arms. He pauses and peers around the edge of a wall at
text: the BATMOBILE two blocks down.
text: The car is still there, the chrome-steel shields intact.
text: But DOZENS OF COPS and CURIOSITY-SEEKERS are SWARMING ALL
text: OVER the fearsome machine.
text: BATMAN snorts in frustration. AN ENORMOUS THREE-TON
text: CATERPILLAR WINCH rumbles up the street toward the
dialog: Batmobile.
text: He's about to get towed. BATMAN takes a RADIO TRANSMITTER
text: from his utility belt and SPEAKS INTO IT.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
text: Shields open.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - ON BATMOBILE
text: TWO COPS are crawling along the hood of the car. From
text: within they hear the tinny computerized voice:
speaker_heading: COMPUTER
text: Shields open.
text: The steel plates begin to retract.
speaker_heading: BATMAN (V.O.)
dialog: (over radio)
dialog: Ignition.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER
dialog: Ignition.
text: The stunned COPS gaze into the Batmobile's cockpit.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: There's somebody in there!
text: They TUMBLE OFF THE HOOD as the turbine engines ROAR TO
text: LIFE and THE BATMOBILE BEGINS TO MOVE.
text: COPS AND ONLOOKERS quickly clear a path. They stand there
text: stunned as the futuristic auto PICKS UP SPEED and advances
text: toward the end of the block. The LEFT TURN SIGNAL flashes
text: dutifully. And the BATMOBILE VANISHES AROUND THE CORNER.
text: PANDEMONIUM BREAKS LOOSE as the COPS bolt for their cars.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: SIRENS WAIL. PASSERSBY STARE SLACKJAWED at the driverless
text: BATMOBILE as it tears down the street, passing, darting,
text: dodging buses and CUTTING OFF TAXIS -- all with a squad of
text: COP CARS in hot pursuit.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT
text: BATMAN sees the BATMOBILE rounding the corner and
text: approaching on the straightaway. He takes VICKI in his arms
text: and STEPS DIRECTLY INTO THE PATH OF THE ONRUSHING
scene_heading: HEADLIGHTS.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: STOP!
text: BRAKES SQUEAL. The BATMOBILE stops one yard short of BATMAN
text: and VICKI. A moment later BATMAN is AT THE WHEEL.
text: SIRENS BUILD. LIGHTS FLASH. The COP CARS are now visible
text: behind them. BATMAN floors the pedal; the Batmobile's
text: powerful AFTERBURNERS kick in; and the hapless cops KILL
text: THEIR SIRENS as BATMAN zooms off into the night at 140 mph.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BACK ROAD - NIGHT
text: A deserted stretch of road, lined by ancient tall pines on
text: either side. The BATMOBILE roars past.
scene_heading: INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT
text: VICKI is gradually coming to on the passenger's side.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: ... How long have I been out?
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Quite a while. I took the scenic
dialog: route.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: (gazing around her)
dialog: Well, I've certainly enjoyed it.
dialog: What's that?
text: He's just hit a BUTTON on the dashboard.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
text: Garage door.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: At the side of the road, a FALLEN TREE, surrounded by
text: underbrush, RISES HYDRAULICALLY INTO THE AIR -- revealing a
text: SECRET ROAD invisible from the main thoroughfare.
text: Doing sixty, the BATMOBILE makes a hairpin turn. Seconds
text: later, the FALLEN TREE drops back magically into place.
scene_heading: INT. BATMOBILE - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
text: As they cruise down the hidden road, VICKI STUDIES BATMAN'S
text: FACE. KNOX's words are very much on her mind.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I meant to ask you. Up on the roof
dialog: -- how did you know my name?
text: BATMAN SMILES in response. VICKI smiles with him.
speaker_heading: VICKI (cont.)
dialog: I'm serious. How did you know?
text: No reply. VICKI frowns, looks through the windshield, and
text: SEES -- much to her horror -- an enormous SHEER CLIFF WALL
text: LOOMING DEAD AHEAD.
text: Wide-eyed, she looks at BATMAN. Still smiling, he HITS THE
text: GAS -- SPEEDING UP. She lets out a SCREAM.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON CLIFF WALL
text: One second to impact. Suddenly the cliff wall VANISHES
text: ALTOGETHER -- revealing, in its place, the GAPING MOUTH OF
scene_heading: AN UNDERGROUND CAVERN.
text: The Batmobile zooms through. A moment later, the CLIFF WALL
text: -- which is nothing more than a HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION --
text: winks back into existence, showing no trace of the cavern.
scene_heading: INT. BATCAVE - NIGHT
dialog: We all know this place. Although we haven't had time to
text: acquire the familiar mementos -- the dinosaur, the giant
text: penny -- the BATCAVE is unmistakable. Vast banks of
text: blinking computers. A state-of-the-art crime lab. A fully-
dialog: equipped workshop for hammering out new toys. It's the
dialog: biggest and best secret clubhouse a boy could wish for.
text: BATMAN climbs out of the car. He removes his cape, strips
text: off his bullet-riddled jersey and his body armor. There are
text: TWO BIG BRUISES on the center of his chest.
text: VICKI looks on as he goes to a rack along one wall and
text: picks out a fresh tunic -- one of four. She wanders over to
text: examine the row of bat-suits -- and the BODY ARMOR.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: What is this stuff? Kevlar?
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Better. It's not on the market yet.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: It doesn't protect your head,
dialog: though.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: That's why I wear a target on my
dialog: chest.
text: THE BATMAN takes obvious pleasure in showing her his
text: futuristic bachelor's pad. His tone is jokey, almost
text: flirtatious. Behind the mask, he's a lot looser, more
dialog: carefree, than some guys we could name...
dialog: ... like Bruce Wayne.
text: VICKI is, to put it mildly, awed. She wanders around gaping
text: at millions of dollars' worth of equipment.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: How'd you find this place?
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Stumbled across it when I was a boy.
text: VICKI'S HEAD jerks up abruptly. In the dim recesses
text: overhead, BATS ARE SCREAMING. She shivers.
speaker_heading: BATMAN (cont.)
dialog: They don't come down here. They're
text: afraid of the lights.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I don't like bats. Not that kind.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: They used to terrify me. But I
dialog: forced myself to keep coming back,
dialog: and --
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: -- I guess I became the thing I
dialog: feared the most. I'll do your photos
dialog: now.
text: He goes to a HIGH-SPEED PHOTO PROCESSING MACHINE -- the
dialog: kind they have at Fotomat, only better -- and loads the
dialog: roll.
text: VICKI wanders over to the edge of a DEEP BLACK PIT. She
text: kicks a pebble over. Long seconds pass; no sound.
text: She looks up. Suspended over the bottomless pit are a pair
text: of GYMNAST'S RINGS. This guy is dedicated.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Who pays for all this?
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: I have sponsors.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: The computers?
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: I'm running a check on the tainted
text: products. There is a pattern.
dialog: Beauty products. Personal hygiene.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: No more makeup. -- Looks like we'll
dialog: all be showing our true faces now.
text: She looks straight at him. It's almost a direct request.
text: But BATMAN is preoccupied with the matter at hand.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: I've tracked all the records. Every
dialog: shipment, every warehouse, every
dialog: loading dock. Nothing. No
dialog: opportunities for tampering. Somehow
dialog: the Joker is supplying tainted
dialog: ingredients... at the source.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Wait. You can just tap into any
dialog: corporate database you want?
dialog: Anywhere?
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Oh, no. I let the FBI do that. Then
dialog: I tap into the FBI. -- Your photos
dialog: are ready.
text: He holds up a hand to VICKI: stand back. Then he checks out
text: the pictures -- SMILING as he shuffles through the prints.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: You could've killed him, you know.
dialog: You could have killed the Joker.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: I had to save you, Vicki.
dialog: (turning to face her)
dialog: Here you go. I think I'll let you
dialog: keep the whole set.
text: She looks at the photos. Joker. Joker. Joker. And four
text: shots of the BATMAN in action. He's without his mask, but
text: there's no clean angle on his face.
text: VICKI doesn't quite know why, but her head is reeling.
speaker_heading: BATMAN (cont.)
dialog: Care for an autograph?
text: He takes one of the prints, scrawls on it, hands it to her
text: with the inscription: "TO VICKI. LOVE, B."
text: Now he turns to shut down the photo machine. VICKI is
text: trembling. Her hand goes to her belt, finds the telephoto
text: roll concealed in her blouse. She steps up silently behind
text: him, reaches for his cowl. At the last second... she STOPS.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: ... Bruce?
text: HE FREEZES IN PLACE for an indecisive moment. Then:
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Are you talking to me?
text: He turns in seeming incomprehension. And shows her a
text: SMILE... the same crooked, curious, childlike smile she saw
text: on BRUCE's face that morning when she caught him singing.
speaker_heading: BATMAN (cont.)
dialog: Maybe we've had enough for one
dialog: night. I'll take you home.
text: Almost in a trance now, she lets him lead her to the
text: BATMOBILE. As she takes her seat he reaches into his
text: utility belt for another KNOCKOUT CAPSULE.
speaker_heading: BATMAN (cont.)
dialog: Do you want to do it this time?
text: VICKI doesn't move. She looks at the capsule in her hand as
text: he walks over to the driver's side and gets in.
speaker_heading: BATMAN (cont.)
dialog: Don't be afraid. I'm here.
text: She takes one last look at the familiar SMILE beneath the
text: mask... then breaks the capsule and BREATHES DEEP.
text: FLAME ERUPTS from the rear of the Batmobile as the after-
text: burners kick in and BATMAN screeches off. A FIERY RED GLOW
text: fills the screen, BURNING OUT THE IMAGE as we
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM STREET - 1963 - NIGHT (DREAM SEQUENCE)
text: The red glow resolves itself into a DREAMLIKE STREET SCENE:
text: liquid, weightless figures moving in a tinted, soundless
text: cityscape as DISTANT, TINKLY CARNIVAL MUSIC plays
text: underneath. We're outside a theatre watching first-nighters
text: emerge from the opening of a hit musical.
text: In the crowd we pick out THREE FIGURES: DR. THOMAS WAYNE,
text: his wife MARTHA, and -- in THOMAS's arms -- their young son
text: BRUCE. BRUCE hasn't made it through the show. He's asleep,
text: head nestled peacefully against his father's shoulder.
text: THOMAS rouses the boy gently, sets him down on the
text: sidewalk. BRUCE rubs the sleep from his eyes as THOMAS puts
text: an arm around his wife. Together they begin walking.
text: IN A SINGLE CUT the crowd has DISAPPEARED, and the WAYNES
text: are walking toward us up a deserted street. THOMAS and
text: MARTHA are laughing, making jokes, reaching down to tousle
text: BRUCE's hair. Their FACES, as they draw closer, are FULL OF
text: JOY. And then, without warning --
text: A HANDGUN enters frame.
text: The WAYNES freeze in their tracks. THOMAS steps
text: protectively in front of his wife, reaches for his wallet,
text: begins unbuckling his watch. He won't put up a fight.
text: MARTHA's hand goes involuntarily to the PEARL NECKLACE at
text: her throat.
text: The GUNMAN sees it, gestures for her to hand it over. But
text: MARTHA is paralyzed, afraid to move.
text: The GUNMAN steps past THOMAS, SNATCHES AT THE NECKLACE.
text: The instant his wife is threatened, THOMAS ATTACKS. The
text: pearl strand BREAKS in the GUNMAN'S HAND as he drops toward
dialog: the sidewalk.
text: A SILENT BURST OF FLAME erupts from the muzzle of the gun.
text: THOMAS CRUMPLES. MARTHA emits a PIERCING SHRIEK -- a shriek
dialog: we cannot hear --
text: -- a shriek cut short by a second burst of flame.
text: BRUCE stands paralyzed in shock. THE GUNMAN scoops a
text: handful of pearls off the sidewalk, reaches for MARTHA's
text: purse, and rises slowly -- his gun levelled directly at the
dialog: boy.
text: Almost catatonic, BRUCE stares down at the corpses of his
text: parents. At their hands, somehow intertwined. At the tiny
text: glinting pearls and the spreading pool of blood around
dialog: them.
text: He looks up with a gaze so bleak, so petrifying... that the
text: GUNMAN turns and runs.
dialog: AND WE CUT. To an exact reproduction of the Pulitzer Prize-
text: winning photo... the cops bent over the bodies, the medics
text: with their stretchers, the boy BRUCE, his arms wrapped
text: tightly around the waist of OFFICER GORDON.
text: There's only one difference. BRUCE's head is turned away
text: from us. We can't see his face.
text: And now a HAND enters the frame. Much like the GUNMAN's
text: hand, but feminine, beckoning. BRUCE, hearing his name,
text: LOOKS UP; then, agonized, ashamed, he BURIES HIS FACE in
text: GORDON's side. GORDON gestures angrily at the intruder.
text: But the hand keeps beckoning. And ultimately BRUCE turns.
text: Showing us the tear-stained face from the famous photo. A
text: face slack with horror. The horror of his parents' death...
dialog: and more importantly, the horror that someone would dare to
dialog: violate this most private and terrible of moments.
text: At last we see what BRUCE sees: a WOMAN crouched on the
text: sidewalk nearby. The WOMAN is holding a camera. The WOMAN
text: is smiling prettily at BRUCE.
speaker_heading: The WOMAN is VICKI VALE.
text: A FLASHBULB EXPLODES. FILLING. THE SCREEN with its blinding
text: white light, SCORCHING OUT THE IMAGE as a HARSH RINGING
text: SOUND cuts through the silence.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: VICKI AWAKENS. She sits up in bed, tremulous, distraught.
text: The bedside phone is ringing. She reaches for it, but her
text: hand freezes in midair. She knows who's calling.
text: Three rings later, she manages to lift the receiver. To her
text: amazement, she finds she cannot speak. Finally, she hears a
text: VOICE at the other end of the line.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (V.O.)
dialog: Vicki... ?
scene_heading: INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S STUDY - NIGHT
text: BRUCE at a big mahogany desk in his somber, book-lined
text: study. The room is dark but for a small table lamp.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Vicki, I've been thinking about you.
dialog: (long pause)
dialog: I know it's late. I'm sorry. I --
dialog: Are you there?
scene_heading: INTERCUT BRUCE AND VICKI
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I'm sorry about the way things went
dialog: between us. I'd very much like to
dialog: see you again.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Well, Bruce... I don't think... that
dialog: would be possible.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I wish you'd reconsider.
dialog: (groping)
dialog: I didn't stand you up today. The
dialog: museum was closed when I got there.
speaker_heading: VICKI

speaker_heading: ON VICKI
text: Her voice trails off. She's profoundly shaken. She knows.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (V.O.)
dialog: Vicki? Vi --
text: She returns the receiver to its cradle.
speaker_heading: ON BRUCE
text: He hears the click. His lips part slightly. He hangs up and
text: sits there at the desk, staring straight ahead.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. VICKI'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: TOTAL DARKNESS. VICKI stands before the bathroom mirror.
text: She holds the OPENED ROLL OF TELEPHOTO SHOTS over the sink.
text: Then she strikes a match. IGNITES the film. Drops it into
text: the sink, and -- with hollow eyes -- WATCHES IT BURN.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT
text: It's four in the morning. VICKI, wrapped in a bathrobe,
text: still shaky, pours her fifth cup of coffee. Sitting across
text: from her is a rumpled and stubbly ALEXANDER KNOX.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Vicki, it all fits. The stuff you're
dialog: telling me -- the car, the equipment
dialog: -- somebody's paying for it.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I just can't --
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: The FBI. You know who's got the FBI
dialog: computer contract? Wayne
dialog: Technologies.
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: The guy's bats all right. He's bat
dialog: shit crazy. This is gonna be the
dialog: most incredible --
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: But he's not.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Not what?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: He's not crazy.
text: KNOX slaps his forehead in frustration, sprawls back in his
dialog: chair.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire
dialog: here... who dresses up like a bat. He
text: goes out at night and swings around
text: -- in his cape -- on a rope.
dialog: (throwing up his hands)
dialog: Okay. Maybe I'm crazy.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Allie... he wants to tell me.
dialog: That's why he took me there. Because
dialog: he's trying to tell me.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Gimme a break. If he wants to chat,
text: he can talk to his car.
text: The joke dies. VICKI stares dead ahead. KNOX looks on in
text: utter disbelief as it all comes into focus: he's lost her
text: loyalty. VICKI is in over her head with BRUCE.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: He has to tell someone. And I'm the
dialog: one. He's trying to tell me.
text: KNOX, hurt in a way he doesn't fully understand, gets up
text: and pulls on his coat. He stares at her coldly:
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Well, when he does you know my
dialog: number.

text: wave at his fellow millionaires on their way down.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Don't sell. It won't last. We'll

text: With exaggerated calm, he hangs up. He lifts the receiver
text: to dial another number, then hesitates and hangs up again.
scene_heading: INT. RECEPTION AREA - A MOMENT LATER - DAY
text: BRUCE, affecting an air of nonchalance, strolls past a
text: squad of SECRETARIES at desks. Phones are ringing off the
dialog: hook.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER - DAY
text: BRUCE ambles past a couple of COLLEAGUES. One of them is
text: shambling catatonically down the hall, bumping into walls.
text: The other is WAILING HYSTERICALLY.
scene_heading: WAILING COLLEAGUE
dialog: ... a nine-million-dollar bath!
text: BRUCE nods in sympathy as they pass. He stops outside the

scene_heading: INT. MEN'S ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY
text: A small anteroom outside the bathroom proper, with a bank
text: of PAY PHONES on one wall. BRUCE checks the bathroom to
text: make sure it's empty, then digs out a quarter and dials a
text: number. He cups one hand confidentially over the receiver:
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (the familiar rasp)
dialog: Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought
dialog: I'd call and see how you're doing.
scene_heading: INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - DAY
speaker_heading: VICKI

scene_heading: INT. MEN'S ROOM - ON BRUCE

speaker_heading: FINANCIER

dialog: (turning)
dialog: Tell him, Jim.

speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Cut the deal.
scene_heading: INT. CITY HALL - NIGHT

speaker_heading: REPORTER II
dialog: Hey Knox, cheer up. It ain't the

scene_heading: INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN
text: Split-screen. On one side is the MAYOR. On the other --

speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Joker here. Can we talk?
text: The MAYOR fumbles for his prepared statement.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: "While this administration remains
dialog: vehemently opposed to terrorism in
dialog: any form, we are prepared to
dialog: negotiate any reasonable demands
dialog: which will guarantee the safety of

speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Huh. Demands. Well, gents, this is
dialog: kinda embarrassing, but... I'm having
dialog: such a swell time, I just haven't
dialog: thought any up.
text: He shrugs. STARTLED REACTIONS from the city officials.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: But I'm a reasonable fella. If you

speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: All right, all right. Here's the

speaker_heading: JOKER

speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: I might just think up some demands.
dialog: And I'm gonna talk to all my
dialog: friends, and see what they want,
dialog: too. And then maybe we'll get

scene_heading: INT. GLOBE CITY ROOM - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: FRANTIC ACTIVITY as REPORTERS rush to their telephones and

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

text: At the base of the statue, WORKMEN are assembling a big

text: Behind him, the iron gates are SLIDING OPEN.
scene_heading: INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - TEN MINUTES LATER - DAY
text: KNOX, agitated, drums his fingers on the edge of a big

speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I've been expecting to hear from
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Well, that's how it is, chum. She
dialog: tells me everything.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What is it you want?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Simple. You know the score. One
dialog: column -- and I can bring all this
dialog: tumbling down. I can take you off
dialog: the streets once and for all.
dialog: (a shaky pause)
dialog: I want you to hang up the suit. And
dialog: I want you to stay away from Vicki.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I can't do that. Not while the
text: Joker's still out there.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Then stay away from Vicki. That's
dialog: all I want, man. I just want your
dialog: word.
text: BRUCE turns away, evading his gaze. KNOX fumbles in his
text: jacket for a cigarette.
speaker_heading: KNOX (cont.)
dialog: See, I don't know how it happened --
dialog: she's a smart girl and you are an
dialog: extraordinarily screwed-up guy -- but
dialog: she's in love with you.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: There's something I don't
dialog: understand. If you've got the story,
dialog: why haven't you printed it?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Because I --
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Because she'd never speak to me
dialog: again.
text: KNOX is a bundle of nerves now. No longer cocky, he stubs
text: out his newly-lit cigarette -- and begins to PLEAD OPENLY.
speaker_heading: KNOX (cont.)
dialog: Come on, Bruce. Be straight. What
dialog: have you got to offer? You gonna
dialog: marry her? Batman and Mrs. Batman?
dialog: (laughing bitterly)
dialog: Gimme a break, huh? Who's gonna be
dialog: Best Rodent?
text: BRUCE sinks into a chair, exhales sharply. He can't even
text: put up an argument. The two of them sit there, not looking
text: at each other, as ALFRED appears in the doorway.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Do you want a drink?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Yeah, a drink. "Civilized." Man-to-

speaker_heading: BRUCE

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM PARK - LATE AFTERNOON

scene_heading: INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - DUSK

speaker_heading: VICKI

dialog: (frightened)
dialog: You're going to get yourself killed,
dialog: Bruce. You know that, don't you?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: It wouldn't matter much.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I don't understand it. You can do so
dialog: much good for people. As Bruce
dialog: Wayne.
text: He sinks back on the sofa, closes his eyes. He's had the
dialog: same argument with himself a thousand times.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Money makes money, Vicki. The
dialog: foundation runs itself. -- I'm
text: extraneous to the process.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: You're one man. You can't save
dialog: everybody.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What it I could save a handful?
dialog: -- What if I could save one?
text: VICKI is sick of watching BRUCE torment himself. She stands
text: up, almost crying now, and ACCUSES HIM DIRECTLY:
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Bruce, at the rate you're going, you
dialog: can't even save yourself.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (staring right at her)
dialog: Sometimes... I don't know if there's
dialog: enough of me left to save.
text: VICKI is totally drained. She heads for the kitchen.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Oh, God. I've got to have some
dialog: coffee or something.
text: A moment's breather as BRUCE sits on the sofa reflecting.
text: Then, suddenly, a KNOCK at the door.
text: VICKI reappears and moves to answer the door. BRUCE -- on
text: his feet instantly -- grabs her by the shoulder.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Are you expecting anyone?
text: She nods no. He goes to the peephole in the door.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (cont.)
dialog: Who's there?
text: THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE he sees a DELIVERY BOY.
speaker_heading: DELIVERY BOY
dialog: Package tor Miss Vale.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
text: Set it down by the door. On the
text: left-hand side.
text: The DELIVERY BOY sets the package down and wanders off,
text: tipless, muttering something about "cheap shits." After a
text: moment's interval, BRUCE opens the door and bends to pick
text: up the mysterious package.
text: Another brown-paper parcel... ADDRESSED IN CRAYON.
speaker_heading: VICKI
speaker_heading: BRUCE!
text: He strides past her, handling the parcel gingerly, and sets
text: it down on the kitchen counter.
speaker_heading: VICKI (cont.)
dialog: It's just like the last time. He
dialog: sent me a present before he --
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.
text: As VICKI watches, he goes into the living-room and finds
text: his ALLIGATOR ATTACHE CASE. He opens the case, removes a
text: LAPTOP COMPUTER and a handful of business papers... then
text: lifts out a false bottom to reveal his UTILITY BELT.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry
dialog: it around with you.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I feel naked without it.
text: He takes out a tiny ULTRASOUND SCANNER -- rather like a
text: stethoscope, with a miniature sonar display where the
text: earpieces should be -- and runs it over the package.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (cont.)
text: Not a bomb. But it could be rigged.
text: Wait in the next room.
text: He takes a small GAS MASK from his belt, puts it on, then
text: SLITS THE WRAPPING with a steak knife.
text: Nothing. Cautiously, he pulls back the flaps. The box is
text: full of STYROFOAM POPCORN. BRUCE shoves a hand down into
text: the popcorn... and extracts a HUMAN EAR.
text: In the doorway behind him, VICKI lets out a squeal.
text: BRUCE grabs the box and dumps TWO DOZEN EARS on the
dialog: counter.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: ... They're wax.
text: VICKI finds a hand-scrawled NOTE among the ears.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: "It worked for Van Gogh. Let's make
dialog: up. I'll need you soon." -- Whew.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (lost in thought)
dialog: That does it. It's going to be this
dialog: weekend.

speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: I thought you ought to know -- he's

scene_heading: ON BRUCE AND VICKI
text: Faces pressed together as they listen in. BRUCE covers the
text: mouthpiece with one hand.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Keep her on the line!
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: ... Where are you calling from?
text: As VICKI struggles to keep the conversation alive, BRUCE
text: rushes into the living room and crouches beside his LAPTOP
text: COMPUTER. He plugs it in, flips open the screen, punches up
dialog: a telecommunications program.
text: A moment later VICKI enters from the kitchen.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --
speaker_heading: BRUCE
text: Finding out where she is.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: How can you do that if she's already
dialog: off the line?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I've had an automatic tracer on this
dialog: number ever since he tracked you to
dialog: the museum.
scene_heading: INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT
text: MASSIVE COMPUTERS click and whir. At BRUCE's prodding,
text: INFORMATION comes up on the monitor: a number, a name --
text: ALICIA HUNT -- and an East Side address.
scene_heading: INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT - EVENING
text: THE SAME INFORMATION scrolls across BRUCE's screen.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Got it!
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: What now!
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Hang on. I have to leave a message.
text: HE FREEZES. He's heard something in the hallway outside.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT
text: ELEVATOR DOORS open on THREE THUGS. One of them uses a key
text: to lock the car in place on VICKI's floor. The key is on
text: the end of a ring which contains dozens of other keys.
text: The KEY RING belongs to a DOORMAN, who's riding in the
text: elevator with the JOKER's trio of thugs. He's dead, alas.
text: The THUGS dump him unceremoniously on the floor of the hall
text: and march toward VICKI's apartment.
scene_heading: INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - A MOMENT LATER
text: BRUCE is nowhere in sight. VICKI is at the sink washing
text: dishes, acting nonchalant. She pretends not to hear the
text: DOOR unlocking behind her.
text: She turns -- and faces the THREE ADVANCING THUGS.
speaker_heading: THUG I
dialog: Hi, Miss Vale. Let's not put up a
dialog: fight, huh? 'Cause we'd hate to have
dialog: to --
text: BRUCE steps into the doorway behind them. With a single
text: sweep of the arm, he flings THREE DRUG-TIPPED NINJA WHEELS
text: at the thugs, catching one in the neck, one in the
text: shoulder, one in the hip. They COLLAPSE in quick
dialog: succession.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: There's a garage in this building?
text: VICKI nods yes. BRUCE -- all business now that he's in his
text: element -- disappears into VICKI's bedroom.
text: She peeks around the corner. He reemerges carrying a BLACK
text: NYLON STOCKING, which he stuffs into his pocket. VICKI is
text: full of question, but he shushes her before she can speak.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (cont.)
dialog: I've got to take him out now.
text: He stoops down beside the THUGS and pulls the elevator key
text: off the key ring -- which he then tosses to VICKI.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (cont.)
dialog: Pick an apartment and stay there.
dialog: And listen: call the police. Give
dialog: them that address. Every available
dialog: man.
text: He starts out the door, stops just long enough to take a
text: dumbfounded VICKI in his arms for a kiss.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING
text: THE JOKER'S VAN, bearing the Monarch Playing Card logo. TWO
text: ARMED GOONS lean against the hood. They watch as the
text: elevator opens and an ordinary fellow in a suit steps out.
text: BRUCE pulls car keys from his pocket and strolls past the
text: thugs, head down, whistling. As he walks around the van,
text: his hand brushes against it -- leaving a MAGNETIZED HOMING
text: DEVICE, almost too tiny to notice, stuck to the fender.
text: He walks another six paces, then stops short. He feels
text: around in all his pockets, making a big show of having
dialog: forgotten something.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Oh, hell!
text: The GOONS eye him curiously as he strides back toward the
text: elevator. The doors are closing before it strikes them that
text: something is amiss.
speaker_heading: GOON
dialog: Hey, boss, something's up. The
text: elevator's working.
scene_heading: INT. VAN - ON JOKER
text: Frustrated, snarling, ready to throw a tantrum.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: DAMMIT! You can't get good help
dialog: these days. -- Let's move out.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - EVENING - OVERHEAD ANGLE
text: From high above the street we see the JOKER'S VAN pulling
text: out of VICKI's building. We're up on the roof, with BRUCE.
text: He hits a button on his utility belt, and a RED SIGNAL
text: LIGHT begins to flash.
text: BRUCE clamps the utility belt around his waist. Pulls the
text: BLACK NYLON STOCKING over his head. And suddenly, he's
text: BOUNDING ACROSS THE ROOFTOPS in pursuit of the JOKER.
scene_heading: EXT. CROSS STREET - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING
text: The VAN turns right at the intersection. Nothing unusual.
text: But for some reason, PEDESTRIANS are pointing at the sky,
text: staring goggle-eyed at the rooftops.
text: Far above them, a MAN -- dressed in a suit, a tie, a yellow
text: belt and a BLACK STOCKING MASK -- is gliding across the
text: intersection on a ROPE.
scene_heading: INT. VAN - A MOMENT LATER
text: The VAN DRIVER guns through a red light. BRAKES SQUEAL on
text: either side. In the back of the van, the JOKER GROWLS:
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Slow down, you maniac!
scene_heading: EXT. INTERSECTION - THAT MOMENT - EVENING
text: As the VAN ROARS PAST, a MOUNTED POLICEMAN shakes his fist.
text: His horse shies, rears back, turns in a circle. He's just
text: about gotten the beast calmed down when a MAN IN A STOCKING
text: MASK plummets down on a rope from nowhere and lands
text: directly behind him on the horse's back.
text: BRUCE elbows the startled COP. Now there's only one rider.
text: The VAN turns left. BRUCE gallops straight ahead through
text: the intersection, hoping to cut the JOKER off.
scene_heading: INT. ALICIA HUNT'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT
text: ALICIA peers out through the window. On the street below,
text: UNMARKED CARS are converging.
scene_heading: INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT
text: The JOKER and co. are two blocks away from ALICIA's. They
text: see a POLICE SWAT TEAM sealing off the building.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Boss! Jesus! They've --
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: They'll be sorry. They'll be
dialog: sorry. -- GET OUT OF HERE!
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT - EVENING
text: BRUCE on horseback, charging past elegant old brownstones,
text: drawing stares from passersby. We get a quick look at the
text: FLASHING RED SIGNAL LIGHT on his belt.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVERVIEW DRIVE - THAT MOMENT - EVENING
text: A YELLOW VW BUG rips up the street at 70 mph.
scene_heading: INT. VOLKSWAGEN BUG - THAT MOMENT
text: We can't see the driver. But we do see, on the seat
text: beside him, a VIDEO DISPLAY with a shifting grid map of the
text: city -- and on it, a FLASHING SIGNAL blinking in perfect
text: sync with the one on BRUCE's belt.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT
text: BRUCE sees the VW bug rounding the corner and STREAKING
text: TOWARD HIM. He reins in the horse; it rears back on its
text: hind legs in a classic western pose; the BUG zooms past --
text: -- and ALFRED THE BUTLER heaves out a BROWN LAUNDRY BUNDLE,
text: neatly tied in string.
text: BRUCE snatches it out of the air, gives ALFRED a quick
text: salute -- and the BUG is gone.
scene_heading: INT. JOKER'S VAN - EVENING
text: The JOKER and his boys are stalled in heavy traffic at the
text: southern border of Gotham Park. POLICE BARRICADES are
text: everywhere; the surrounding streets have been roped off for
text: the birthday gala. HORNS HONK in anger.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: MOVE! Can't you do something??
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: It's some kind of detour. They're
dialog: backed up for blocks!
text: The JOKER snorts. He happens to glance into the side-view
text: mirror. What he sees there... CURDLES HIS BLOOD.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Oh my God. How does he do it... ?
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - A BLOCK AWAY - THAT MOMENT
text: THE BATMAN, IN FULL COSTUMED GLORY, GALLOPING UP THE STREET
text: ON HORSEBACK -- passing stunned COPS, weaving in and around
text: the stalled autos, GAINING FAST on the JOKER.
scene_heading: INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT
text: THE JOKER climbing all over the DRIVER. He HITS THE GAS,
text: RUNS THE VAN UP ON THE SIDEWALK, and -- at the first
text: opening he sees -- CRASHES THROUGH A POLICE BARRICADE INTO
text: GOTHAM PARK ITSELF.
text: BATMAN is half a block behind him now. As he follows hot on
text: the JOKER's heels, TWO HELICOPTERS swing into the park from
text: overhead.
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM PARK - EVENING
text: CROWDS EVERYWHERE. On the central platform where we saw the
text: FREE CONCERT earlier, an EMCEE mans the microphone:
speaker_heading: EMCEE
dialog: -- the most spectacular, most death-
dialog: defying aerial stunt ever devised.
dialog: Tonight -- for the first time
dialog: anywhere -- THE FLYING GRAYSONS!
text: He points up at the two approaching HELICOPTERS, flying
text: side-by-side in tight formation some forty feet apart.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON HELICOPTERS
text: ONLOOKERS GASP as TWO TRAPEZES drop from the bellies of the
text: twin copters. Dangling from the trapezes are the FLYING
text: GRAYSONS -- a husband-and-wife aerialist team in spangled
text: red-and-green suits. They begin swinging toward each other
text: in a plane perpendicular to the path of the copters.
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM PARK - GROUND LEVEL
text: PANIC DOWN BELOW as the JOKER's van barrels through the
text: crowd, HORN BLARING. BATMAN is moving up swiftly.
text: On each wrist he's wearing a MINIATURE ROCKET LAUNCHER. He
text: lets fly with TWO SALVOS. The first explodes harmlessly
text: against a tree. The second HITS THE REAR DOOR OF THE VAN --
text: driving it off the access road down into the brush, where
text: it nearly topples over sideways.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON FLYING GRAYSONS
text: GRAYSON has just completed a double somersault in midair,
text: landing in the capable hands of his wife. Now they're
text: swinging again, building momentum as he prepares to make
text: the return leap back to his own trapeze.
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER - THAT MOMENT
text: In the bay of the helicopter stands a kid, fifteen,
text: compact, tough, and wiry: DICK GRAYSON. Like his parents,
text: he's wearing a red-and-green suit. From the copter, he's
text: got a perfect bird's-eye view of the BATMAN-JOKER chase.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Ready to go, Dick?
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: What's all the ruckus down there?
scene_heading: EXT. PARK - GROUND LEVEL - THAT MOMENT
text: The VAN bounces over rocks and bushes, narrowly avoiding
text: trees, with BATMAN in hot pursuit.
scene_heading: INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT
text: At the foot of a hill, the JOKER spies a truck. On its
text: side, in bright red letters, a WARNING: "DANGER -
scene_heading: FIREWORKS. FLAMMABLE LOAD."
text: The JOKER reaches into the back for a HIGHWAY FLARE.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Head for the truck!
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER - THAT MOMENT
text: Hovering over the chase scene, DICK catches sight of the
text: JOKER. He GASPS IN SHOCK as a LIT FLARE flies from the back
text: of the VAN... directly into the FIREWORKS TRUCK.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK - GROUND LEVEL - A MOMENT LATER
text: THE BATMAN is thrown off his horse by the shock of a
text: massive EXPLOSION. All at once, THE SKY IS FULL of
text: BURSTING, INCANDESCENT COLORS!!
text: THE JOKER hangs out of the rear of the van, looking up, an
text: expression of PURE DELIGHT on his face.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I love fireworks!
scene_heading: ANGLE ON HELICOPTERS
text: LURCHING AND SPINNING IN THE SKY as FIREWORKS rocket past.
text: One of them takes a dead hit on the rotor. JOHN GRAYSON
text: falls to his death instantly; a moment later, the COPTER
text: plummets into the trees with a resounding, fiery CRASH.
text: MARY GRAYSON hangs from the second copter as it bobs and
text: weaves out of control. ONLOOKERS SCREAM IN TERROR.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT
text: THE JOKER'S VAN bursts out of the park and speeds up a
text: wide, cordoned-off avenue. Overhead, THE SECOND COPTER
text: veers wildly, out of the park now, swinging dangerously
text: close to the tall buildings along the avenue.
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER - THAT MOMENT
text: DICK GRAYSON at the mouth of the bay, hanging on by a
text: canvas strap. He watches helplessly as his MOTHER swings
text: into a POWER LINE and drops three stories to the pavement.
speaker_heading: DICK
text: NO! NOOOOOOOO!!!!
text: His face is contorted with rage and pain. The PILOT
text: struggles desperately to right the copter, barely avoiding
text: a collision with the nearest building. And then -- before
text: THE PILOT can make a move to stop him -- DICK HAS JUMPED
text: OUT OF THE COPTER.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON DICK
text: With astonishing physical grace, he DIVES. GRABS A
text: FLAGPOLE. Executes a perfect somersault. FLIPS onto a
text: nearby fire escape. VAULTS to the next fire escape down.
text: And LEAPS OUT OVER THE STREET --
text: -- MAKING A PERFECT TWO-POINT LANDING on his intended
text: target... THE ROOF OF THE JOKER'S VAN!!
scene_heading: INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT
text: THE JOKER hears a THUNK overhead. He casually lifts his gun
text: and BLOWS A HOLE THROUGH THE ROOF OF THE VAN.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOF OF VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT
text: The blast just misses DICK. He sprawls flat, YANKS at the
text: chrome luggage rack on the roof of the van, and BREAKS OFF
text: A FOUR-FOOT SHAFT OF METAL.
text: ANOTHER SHOT through the roof. DICK rolls forward, hoists
text: his chrome spear over the windshield.
scene_heading: INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT
text: SPLINTERED GLASS flies everywhere as DICK RAMS THE SHAFT
text: THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD. THE DRIVER dodges left and LOSES
text: CONTROL OF THE WHEEL.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOF OF VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT
text: The VAN careens wildly toward an OVERPASS. DICK rises up
text: into a crouch just in time to see a sign which reads
text: "DANGER -- LOW CLEARANCE." He's about to get his head taken
dialog: off!
text: ONE SECOND BEFORE IMPACT a BLACK-CAPED SHADOW swings across
text: the street and SCOOPS DICK OFF THE ROOF OF THE VAN.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: BATMAN AND DICK tumble to the pavement. THE VAN knocks over
text: a fire hydrant and STOPS. DICK is already on his feet,
text: ready to CHARGE THE VAN, when BATMAN throws a powerful arm
text: around his waist.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: LET ME GO! LET ME --
text: THE JOKER steps casually out of the van. TWO GOONS with
text: MACHINE GUNS emerge behind him. PEDESTRIANS SCREAM as the
text: GOONS level their guns at the CROWD.
speaker_heading: DICK (cont.)
dialog: YOU PIECE OF -- YOU MOTHERF--
text: DICK is kicking, screaming, clawing, biting. BATMAN has his
text: hands full restraining the kid.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Like your boyfriend. He's kinda
dialog: hot.
dialog: (glowering at BATMAN)
text: Hands off the belt.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Take me. Let the boy go.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Gosh, I could kill you, but then
dialog: you'd miss my party. And I'd be
dialog: real, real sad if you couldn't make
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Batman! Don't you even recognize
dialog: your old pal Jack? After all...
dialog: (cackling insanely)
dialog: You made me what I am today.
text: BATMAN cocks his head in puzzlement as DISTANT SIRENS
text: BLARE. The JOKER and his HOODS -- guns still aimed at the
text: crowd -- back away and race off on foot, vanishing into the
dialog: night.
text: DICK BREAKS FREE and BOLTS AFTER THEM. BATMAN throws him to
text: the street with a flying tackle. The boy is hysterical.
speaker_heading: DICK
text: HE KILLED MY PARENTS! HE KILLED
speaker_heading: MY --
text: BATMAN flinches at the sound of the words. He reaches into
text: his belt and -- mercifully -- breaks a KNOCKOUT CAPSULE
text: under DICK's nose.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN
text: A taped report from the hallway outside ALICIA's apartment.
text: COPS and FORENSICS MEN mill about in the b.g.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: ... on a tip attributed to the
dialog: mysterious Batman. The apartment was
text: booby-trapped with the Joker's
text: laughing gas, leaving 17 policemen
dialog: dead.
dialog: (beat)
text: Also found dead at the scene was
dialog: Alicia Hunt, 26, a former model --
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that the TV SCREEN is part of
text: BRUCE'S BANK OF MONITORS, deep in the Batcave. The other
text: screens show the various rooms of Wayne Manor, all empty.
text: We move now to the video display of a COMPUTER WORKSTATION,
text: showing TWO FACES side-by-side: a mug shot of JACK NAPIER
text: and a freeze-frame of the JOKER from one of his pirate
text: transmissions. A GRAPHICS PROGRAM abstracts the twin heads
text: into THREE-DIMENSIONAL, ROTATING TOPOLOGICAL GRIDS -- and,
text: as we watch, the two spinning heads COLLIDE AND MERGE.
text: Except for the fearsome grin, they MESH PERFECTLY.
text: Yet another terminal: BRUCE's database. The same phrase
text: flashes again and again, scrolling up the screen: ACE
scene_heading: CHEMICAL CO. ACE CHEMICAL CO. ACE CHEMICAL CO.
text: And, finally: BRUCE HIMSELF, slumped at a table, his head
text: in his hands. He's realized, to his horror, that he is
dialog: responsible for the birth of the Joker. And frankly...
dialog: he would just as soon be dead.
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - GUEST BEDROOM - DAY
text: DICK GRAYSON is sprawled on a huge four-poster bed,
text: unconscious, softly moaning. He COMES TO with a jolt.
text: Breaking into a sweat almost instantly, he looks at his
text: unfamiliar surroundings. A shadowy figure stands nearby.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: ... Where am I?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: My name is Bruce Wayne. You're
dialog: welcome to stay here as long as you
dialog: want.
text: BRUCE steps out just as ALFRED enters with a breakfast
text: tray. DICK makes a puzzled face. What the hell is going on
dialog: here?
scene_heading: INT. HALL OF JUSTICE - DAY
text: Beneath the statue of blind Justice, BRUCE and HARVEY DENT
text: march through the portico, engaged in a heated argument.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: We'll send a team into Ace the
text: moment the warrant comes through.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: He'll be ready when you do. Remember
dialog: what happened at the apartment.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: All right, Bruce, what do you
dialog: suggest?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I suggest a nice big bomb.
speaker_heading: DENT
text: Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from
dialog: Bruce Wayne. -- We do have laws.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel
dialog: the anniversary celebration.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: We've told him we'll deal. What
dialog: could he possibly have to gain by --
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Do you still think the Joker cares
dialog: about money??
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: I don't know. I'm just a D.A. I
dialog: don't have access to all your
dialog: expert sources.
text: Mexican standoff. BRUCE stalks off fuming. DENT hangs back
text: a moment, then turns down the hall.
scene_heading: EXT. WAYNE MANOR - ESTABLISHING - DAY
text: The ornate, wrought-iron GATE which opens on the long
text: driveway snaking up toward Wayne Manor. It's bolted shut.
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY
text: A glass-enclosed room which houses an enormous HEATED
text: INDOOR SWIMMING POOL. DICK GRAYSON does a couple of laps,
text: then climbs out and towels himself off.
text: He looks out at the estate: tennis courts, a riding stable
text: in the distance. He's not happy. All this opulence could
text: drive a guy stark staring nuts in short order.
scene_heading: INT. GUEST BEDROOM - DAY
text: An OPEN SUITCASE on the bed. DICK fingers a gold ashtray
text: bearing the figure of Winged Victory -- then shrugs and
text: tosses it into the suitcase on top of his gymnast's
text: costume. When he looks up he sees BRUCE in the doorway
text: behind him.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: ... Your butler wouldn't gimme a ride
dialog: so I figured I'd hoof it.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Sorry. I can't let you leave.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: You can't keep me here, man. That's
dialog: kidnapping.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: If I let you leave, you'll do the
dialog: same thing again. You'll go after
dialog: the Joker... and you'll wind up dead.
dialog: (turning to go)
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Hey, man. Look at you. You're
dialog: rich. You got everything you want.
dialog: How do you know what's in my mind?
text: BRUCE turns to face him. The little hellion's eyes are
text: filled with raw, burning hatred. BRUCE knows the feeling.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I don't care what's in your mind.
dialog: You're staying.
text: BRUCE reaches for a key in his pocket. Without warning, the
text: kid RUSHES him, throwing a rock-solid punch. With blinding
text: speed, BRUCE sidesteps him, parries the blow, and winds up
text: spinning DICK around -- INTO A WALL.
text: DICK is stunned, but he has to laugh. This rich boy has a
text: move or two. BRUCE stands there, silently challenging him.
text: A second later, the kid is airborne -- upping the ante with
text: a scissor-kick aimed squarely at BRUCE's gut. In a blur of
text: motion BRUCE checks the kick, swings an arm into DICK's
text: chest, and sends the boy sprawling flat on his back.
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT
text: ALFRED, in his apron, fixing a tray of snacks. He looks up
text: curiously at the ceiling. From the sound of it, a battle
text: royal is shaping up in the guest bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. GUEST BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT
text: DICK'S BODY -- head down, feet up -- flies through the air.
text: He SMASHES INTO a closet door and slumps to the carpet.
text: Shaken now, and sweating profusely, he looks up at BRUCE...
text: who stands calmly over him, adjusting his necktie.
text: A long, tense moment passes between them. Then:
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: ... You're him.
text: No reply from BRUCE. Their gazes lock. And suddenly...
speaker_heading: ALFRED (V.O.)
speaker_heading: FREEZE!
text: DICK and BRUCE look around. The puny, mustachioed butler
text: stands in the doorway, feet spread in a Dirty Harry stance,
text: a .44 MAGNUM trained on DICK.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: It's all right, Alfred. Everything's
text: under control.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: ... Very good, sir.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - AFTERNOON

speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Thankya, thankya. Ladies and germs,
dialog: I'm here to tell you... we have had

speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
text: Panic's up. Terror's up. And fear --
dialog: fear's gone straight through the
dialog: roof. You guys should be proud --
dialog: 'cause I couldn'ta done it without
dialog: each and every one of you!
text: MORE CANNED APPLAUSE. The JOKER takes a bow.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: I feel it's time to expand the
dialog: Joker line. I was askin' myself,
dialog: what are the products that every
dialog: consumer wants most? And that's when
dialog: it hit me: the water you drink, and
dialog: the air you breathe! Huh? Bingo!
dialog: (strutting across stage)
dialog: Now, some of you have your eye on
dialog: the profit margin. You're thinkin':
dialog: this boy's too ambitious. You
dialog: don't approve. In fact, some of you
dialog: have been talking about turning me
dialog: in to the cops. Or knocking me off.
text: He pauses. GLARES OUT at the audience. NO RESPONSE.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: But that's okay. I understand. Not
dialog: everyone shares my eye for beauty.
dialog: And just to show there's no hard
dialog: feelings, I'm throwin' a little
dialog: shindig tonight -- and you're all
dialog: invited!
text: THE CANNED APPLAUSE goes right off the meter.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: How 'bout it? IS EVERYBODY HAPPY??
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE - THE AUDIENCE
text: Familiar faces all around -- the major players of the
text: Gotham underworld. But despite the enormous twisted grins,
text: no one here is laughing or applauding. No one here is
text: living. The JOKER is playing to a roomful of smiling
dialog: corpses.
text: One of them topples out of his chair and lands with a plop.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Look at that, folks. We got 'em
dialog: rolling in the aisles!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - TOWARD DUSK
text: VICKI lies in BRUCE's bed, under the covers, propped up on

text: looking out at his estate.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: All this apparatus, Vicki... this
dialog: house, and the money, and the
dialog: power... it was never mine. It was
dialog: something I inherited. Bruce Wayne
dialog: was something I inherited.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: All I ever hoped for was someone who
dialog: could see through Bruce -- who could
dialog: see me -- and not be frightened.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I'm not frightened of you, Bruce.
dialog: I'm frightened for you.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: In all these years... why couldn't I
dialog: see how it would turn out?
text: He turns toward her. His face is ravaged with guilt. Now
text: she's truly afraid.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (cont.)
dialog: I'm responsible, Vicki. If it wasn't
dialog: for me, there'd be no Joker.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BATCAVE - EVENING
text: TIGHT ON a tiny electronic device: two cylindrical steel
text: casings bracketed together, topped by a DIGITAL TIMER.
text: BRUCE makes a few adjustments with a jeweler's screwdriver,
text: hits a trigger, and watches the TIMER tick off seconds. 30.
text: 29. 28. At 25 seconds, BRUCE kills the
text: countdown and CLAMPS THE DEVICE into an empty packet on his
text: utility belt.
text: He stands up wearily. He's in his bat-suit, minus the cape
text: and cowl. Behind him, hanging back discreetly in the
text: shadows, is his loyal butler ALFRED.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Where's the boy?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
text: Upstairs. He's quite docile.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I know that feeling. It won't last.
text: BRUCE takes a moment to survey the Batcave as ALFRED looks
text: on tremulously.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (cont.)
dialog: He's a long way ahead of where I was
text: at his age.
speaker_heading: (taking ALFRED's
dialog: shoulders)
dialog: I want you to treat him just as if
dialog: he were me. Promise.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: He'll be taken care of financially.
dialog: Beyond that... you know what to do.
dialog: Don't let all this go to waste.
text: Their eyes lock for a long moment. ALFRED is unable to
text: speak. Finally BRUCE turns and starts slowly up the long
text: circular stairway which leads from the Batcave to Wayne
text: Manor. On the third step he pauses:
speaker_heading: BRUCE (cont.)
dialog: Alfred? -- Thank you.
text: As BRUCE disappears up the stairs, a shaken ALFRED steadies
text: himself against a lab table, fighting back tears.
scene_heading: INT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - EVENING
text: BRUCE draws the curtains, sets an alarm clock. The current
text: time is 7:09 PM.
text: He sits cross-legged on the floor, slumps forward slightly,
text: and closes his eyes. He inhales, exhales, taking deep,
text: regular breaths. His muscles relax. Ten seconds later,
text: BRUCE has plunged into DEEP SLEEP.
text: Time passes. The clock shows 7:19, 7:32.
text: At 7:44 we TRACK IN on BRUCE's unconscious face, drawing
text: closer and closer until HIS EYELIDS FILL THE FRAME,
text: twitching with the irregular movement characteristic of
text: R.E.M. sleep. Without warning his EYES SNAP OPEN.
text: HOLD ON BRUCE'S GAZE -- grim, alert, determined -- as the
text: clock hits 7:45. An ALARM SOUNDS, BREAKING THE SILENCE with
text: its grating electronic WHINE.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ACE CHEMICAL - AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT
text: The trademark ace on the illuminated sign. From our vantage
text: point high above, we can see THREE CARGO TRUCKS rolling out

text: off... preparing for a final showdown with the JOKER's
dialog: forces.
scene_heading: INT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: The JOKER'S MINIONS, working late, readying a huge

speaker_heading: DISPATCHER
dialog: Boston, Philly: loading bay one.
scene_heading: EXT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: The BATMOBILE stops short of the main gate. ENGINES ROAR

text: taking half the chain-link fence with it.
text: In the guard's booth, ARMED GOONS pull guns as the
text: BATMOBILE streaks across the parking lot and LAUNCHES A
text: ROCKET at the corrugated metal door which opens on the
text: factory floor. A THUNDEROUS EXPLOSION tears a gaping hole
text: in the door.
scene_heading: INT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: The BATMOBILE cruises through the flaming wreckage and
text: SKIDS TO A HALT on the refinery floor. The JOKER'S MEN are
text: everywhere. They take one look at the BATMOBILE, PANIC, and
text: PELT THE CAR with a barrage of MACHINE-GUN FIRE.
text: CRACKS begin to spread across the Batmobile's plexiglass
text: dome. Within moments, the windshield SHATTERS -- and
text: COLLAPSES ALTOGETHER.
scene_heading: INT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT
text: BULLETS rip through the upholstered passenger seats. It

speaker_heading: COMPUTER
dialog: ... Detonate.
text: A beat. Then: BLAM.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: A CONVOY approaches Ace Chemical -- GORDON's team preparing

speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Good Lord!
scene_heading: EXT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: THE JOKER'S MEN running for their lives across the parking
text: lot, KNOCKED FLAT by the force of SIX DEAFENING EXPLOSIONS.
text: For a few seconds everything is flame and fury. And then --

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ANDREWS ISLAND - NIGHT
text: DAZZLING FIREWORKS explode in the night sky over Gotham

text: THOUSANDS OF RUBBERNECKERS jam every square inch of
text: Andrew's Island. COPS ON HORSEBACK speak into walkie-

text: Harbor, Ace Chemical is going up in flames -- but as far as
text: the crowd can tell, with all the noise and excitement, it's
text: just another part of the celebration.
text: At the base of the statue, GOVERNOR GILROY speaks into a

dialog: America's favorite lady... LADY
speaker_heading: GOTHAM!
text: The CROWD begins to APPLAUD RHYTHMICALLY, chanting 'LADY
text: GOTHAM! LADY GOTHAM!' It's like Times Square on New Year's
text: Eve, waiting for the big ball to drop. GILROY hoists a pair
text: of oversized scissors and cuts a ceremonial ribbon:
text: hydraulic CRANES kick into gear: CABLES DROP FREE, and the
text: canvas cover draws back from LADY GOTHAM's face...
text: ... to a chorus of SCREAMS from the crowd. LADY GOTHAM IS
text: WEARING A GRISLY JOKER GRIN!!!
text: Suddenly -- in the midst of the hysteria -- THE
text: SEARCHLIGHTS DIE. The STAGE LIGHTS BLINK OUT. ANDREWS
text: ISLAND IS PLUNGED INTO DARKNESS. Instantaneous mass panic:
text: the GOVERNOR shouts to his aides as ONLOOKERS mob the

text: QUICK SHOTS of FOUR HELICOPTERS hovering at different
text: points over the blacked-out city. LOUDSPEAKERS blare out a
scene_heading: PRE-RECORDED MESSAGE:
speaker_heading: JOKER (V.O.)
dialog: HAPPY BIRTHDAY, Gotham. Here's a
dialog: little token of my esteem. HAVE
dialog: FUN... 'cause THE PARTY'S ON ME!
text: INSANE LAUGHTER echoes. CARGO BAYS open wide. The JOKER'S
text: HELICOPTERS begin LEAFLETING THE CITY... with MONEY!
speaker_heading: SERIES OF SHOTS
text: ANARCHY IN GOTHAM as high-denomination bills flutter to
text: earth, blanketing the streets. HOPELESSLY OUTMANNED COPS
text: try to maintain order as SOLID CITIZENS trample one another
text: in a paroxysm of ANIMAL GREED. BUILDINGS EMPTY as APARTMENT
text: DWELLERS race outside. ALL TRAFFIC STOPS as DRIVERS climb
text: out of their cars to SNATCH MONEY FROM THE AIR.
text: DARKNESS EVERYWHERE. In the pitch-black subways, TERRIFIED
text: COMMUTERS are seized by claustrophobia. GLASS SHATTERS,
text: DOORS BREAK OPEN as they claw their way out of stalled
text: subway cars and SPILL OUT onto the tracks.
text: On the streets above, GOTHAM'S CRIMINAL ELEMENT is having a
text: field day. The cops are preoccupied, utterly helpless
text: against the first waves of RIOTING AND LOOTING.
text: FLAMES ERUPT. PUNKS race down the street carrying fur coats
text: and color TV's. LOOTERS break through the display window of
text: an electronics store, and climb in among the goodies...
text: only to FLY OUT, two seconds later, on the wrong end of a
text: SHOTGUN BLAST. THE JOKER'S DREAM IS COMING TRUE.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: In a crouch on the pavement, snapping photos of the wild
dialog: street action, is VICKI -- fearless, professional, doing
text: her job. A battered FORD ESCORT cruises up behind her.
speaker_heading: KNOX
speaker_heading: VICKI!
text: VICKI sees KNOX, climbs into the passenger seat. He's
text: wearing a big smile. They're jazzed, oblivious to danger.
speaker_heading: KNOX (cont.)
dialog: Couldn't turn down the job, huh? A
dialog: girl could get hurt this way.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Yeah. Deja vu.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: What do you say? Let's head for the
dialog: lights.
text: In the distance, above the tops of the buildings, BEACONS
text: are sweeping the sky.
scene_heading: EXT. BROAD AVENUE - NIGHT
text: Stationed all up and down Gotham's widest thoroughfare are
text: huge portable SEARCHLIGHTS -- mounted on trucks with
text: portable generators, unaffected by the power outage.
text: On the money-covered sidewalks, TOTAL BEDLAM. But on the
text: street itself, a bizarre PARADE is taking place, just as if
text: nothing's wrong. Rumbling up the avenue at two-block
text: intervals, moored to floats, are DOZENS OF ENORMOUS
text: BALLOONS in the shapes of cartoon characters and historical
text: figures. It's like a hellish Thanksgiving's day procession.
text: The LEAD-OFF BALLOON is a gigantic, grotesque CLOWN --
text: smiling ghoulishly, dressed in white pierrot frills. We
text: TILT DOWN to the FLOAT BENEATH IT...
text: ... and there, atop a mountain of roses where the prom
text: queen should be, sits the JOKER -- smiling, waving daintily
text: at the rioters and looters, presiding over the carnage like
text: some demented parade marshal.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - NIGHT
text: A desolate rural setting. UTTER SILENCE. Moonlight glints
text: on placid waters. We track in on a small sign bearing the
text: legend: "GOTHAM CITY RESERVOIR."
text: Far off in the distance, HEADLIGHTS ARE APPROACHING.
scene_heading: EXT. ACCESS ROAD - AERIAL SHOT - MOVING - NIGHT
text: The THREE CARGO TRUCKS from Ace Chemical roll ominously
text: TOWARD THE RESERVOIR on their deadly mission. And then -- A
text: STREAKING BLACK SHADOW ENTERS FRAME, overtaking the TRUCKS.
text: THE BATWING! A phenomenal ULTRALIGHT AIRCRAFT, swift,
text: sleek, jet-black and infinitely maneuverable, it SOARS
text: EASILY past the trucks, swooping low just long enough to
text: release a BOMB over a concrete bridge.
scene_heading: EXT. ACCESS ROAD - A MOMENT LATER
text: The BRIDGE EXPLODES, blocking the trucks' path to the
text: reservoir. PUZZLED DRIVERS climb out of their cabs and
dialog: wonder what to do next.
text: They spot the BATWING in the distance -- banking, doing a
text: sharp 180. For a moment they gape in disbelief. Then they
text: HEAD FOR THE TREES as the BATWING DIVES DIRECTLY AT THE
text: TRUCKS, firing THREE ARMOR-PIERCING SHELLS... and
text: destroying the JOKER's lethal cargo once and for all.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON BATMAN
text: in the cockpit, his jaw set, not even looking back at the
text: wreckage as his plane screams off toward the Gotham
text: skyline.
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM STREET - NIGHT
text: FRIGHTENED PEDESTRIANS race past OVERTURNED CARS. A PARADE
text: FLOAT, run aground on the sidewalk, begins to BURN.
text: Above it, a damaged BALLOON -- the cartoon character
text: UNDERDOG -- is losing helium, warping and buckling in on
text: itself, sinking down gently toward the flames. Down the
text: street, KNOX'S FORD ESCORT is coming up fast.
scene_heading: INT. FORD - MOVING - THAT MOMENT
text: VICKI snapping photos out the window as UNDERDOG drifts
text: downward. FLAMES lick up at his belly -- and the cartoon
text: blimp EXPLODES.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: So much for Underdog.
text: THEN -- as they drive past -- A SECOND EXPLOSION. And all
text: at once the STREET IS FULL OF DEADLY GREENISH GAS!
speaker_heading: VICKI
text: ALLIE!! THE WINDOWS!!
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
text: The Ford Escort, windows up, swerves out of a THICK
text: SPREADING CLOUD of GREEN LAUGHING GAS -- threatening to
dialog: engulf the entire block!
scene_heading: INT. FORD - MOVING - THAT MOMENT
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: WHAT HAPPENED?!?
text: VICKI stares back at the green cloud. Turns. And sees, up
text: the street, THE JOKER'S PROCESSION: BALLOONS BY THE DOZEN!
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Oh my God. Compressor tanks. He's
dialog: got the balloons rigged with
dialog: compressor tanks!!
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Jesus Christ, the guy's a genius.
scene_heading: INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: BATMAN, at the controls, gliding over the Gotham streets.
text: He looks down, sees a BILLOWING HAZE of DENSE GREEN FUMES.
text: At its periphery: LOOTERS reeling and staggering, falling
text: to the pavement, LAUGHING THEMSELVES TO DEATH.
scene_heading: INT. FORD - MOVING - THAT MOMENT
text: VICKI staring through the windshield. Overhead, an AIRCRAFT
text: streaks past... an aircraft with SCALLOPED BLACK BAT WINGS.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!!
dialog: (frantically)
dialog: Allie -- the balloons. We've got to
dialog: find some way to tell him!
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Great. How??
text: They speed up the street toward the PARADE. SPOTLIGHTS
text: SHINE. Suddenly KNOX's eyes bug out. He SLAMS ON THE BRAKES
text: and SKIDS TO A HALT.
speaker_heading: KNOX (cont.)
dialog: COME ON!
scene_heading: EXT. AVENUE - A SECOND LATER - NIGHT
text: Before VICKI can speak, KNOX has grabbed a tire iron from
text: the back of the car and RACED OUT ONTO THE STREET. He
text: flings the TIRE IRON through a glass STOREFRONT.
text: It's a COSTUME SHOP. In the window, MANNEQUINS dressed in
dialog: party costumes: Frankenstein. Ronald Reagan. And, that
dialog: current popular sensation... THE BATMAN.
text: As VICKI catches up with him, KNOX drags the Batman dummy
text: out of the store window. RIPS OFF ITS BLACK CAPE. And
text: DASHES MANIACALLY UP THE SIDEWALK.
text: Waving the cape, he VAULTS onto the back of a SPOTLIGHT
text: TRUCK. VICKI's face goes slack. Now she gets it.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: GIMME A HAND UP HERE!
text: VICKI climbs aboard. They drape the cape over the face of
text: the spotlight. Then they put their shoulders to the swivel
text: assembly -- tilting the spotlight -- AIMING THE BEAM...
text: ... DIRECTLY AT THE JOKER'S WHITE CLOWN BALLOON!!!
scene_heading: INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT
text: BATMAN stares at the CLOWN BALLOON dead ahead. On its
text: massive distended belly... a BURNING YELLOW OVAL. And in
text: the center of the oval... THE BLACK SILHOUETTE OF A BAT.
text: BATMAN'S MOUTH drops open. He understands.
scene_heading: EXT. AVENUE - ON JOKER'S FLOAT - THAT MOMENT
text: THE JOKER reaches into a big sack and begins distributing
text: MINIATURE GAS MASKS, like party favors, to his cronies on
text: the float. Then he pulls out a radio-operated REMOTE
text: CONTROL DEVICE and points it up at the CLOWN BALLOON.
text: He hits a button. The CLOWN begins to INFLATE. Its joints
text: bulge. Its FACE SWELLS UP as the COMPRESSOR TANK concealed
text: inside it releases its noxious contents. The JOKER is
text: BEAMING, a look of PURE UNALLOYED JOY on his face...
text: ... when his PARADE FLOAT BLOWS TO SMITHEREENS BENEATH HIM!
text: The JOKER and his men CARTWHEEL THROUGH THE AIR and TUMBLE
text: TO THE ASPHALT as THE BATWING WHIPS PAST OVERHEAD, soaring
text: through the stone canyons of Gotham at a 90-degree angle to
dialog: the ground!
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: No... NOOOOO!!!
scene_heading: ANGLE ON CLOWN BALLOON
text: as it rises, rises, swelling to grotesque proportions in
text: the starless night. The tallest buildings are far below it
text: now. Finally it BURSTS -- and the deadly GAS inside it
text: disperses harmlessly in the wind.
scene_heading: EXT. AVENUE - THAT MOMENT
text: THE JOKER on the edge of a tantrum as he digs amid the
text: rubble of his float for the remote device. At last he finds
text: it; aims it up at the other balloons in the procession;
text: hits a button repeatedly...
text: ... and HOWLS IN FRUSTRATION. Nothing's happening. The
text: damned thing is broken. He heaves it to the street in a
text: fit of pique.
text: A SCREAMING COMES ACROSS THE SKY as the BATWING swings back
text: for another pass, BUZZING the JOKER at an altitude of
text: twenty feet. SIZZLING LASER FIRE sweeps the street.
text: CABLES SNAP and BALLOONS DRIFT UPWARD as BATMAN'S LASERS
text: sever their moorings. The JOKER can only look on
text: helplessly, in stunned disbelief.
text: As he's watching his plans evaporate... HIS EYES FALL ON
scene_heading: THE MAKESHIFT BAT-SIGNAL.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: There. There. -- GET 'EM!!
text: ANGLE ON SPOTLIGHT TRUCK
text: A SPRAY OF MACHINE-GUN FIRE shatters the Bat-signal. KNOX
text: throws VICKI to the street, ducks down behind the
text: spotlight, and tosses her his CAR KEYS.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: GET THE CAR!
text: The JOKER'S GOONS are coming up fast as VICKI reaches the
text: Ford, starts it, and comes ROARING UP toward KNOX. He jumps
text: off the truck as VICKI twists the wheel, lays a track of
text: rubber, and noses the car back in the opposite direction.
text: GUNFIRE as KNOX jumps inside and they PEEL OUT.
scene_heading: INT. FORD ESCORT - MOVING - A MOMENT LATER
text: KNOX's breathing is ragged, but he breaks out in HYSTERICAL
text: LAUGHTER nonetheless. The two of them are totally
text: exhilarated. They can't believe what they've just done.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: HOLY SHIT!!
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU
dialog: SEE THAT?!
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: (laughing wildly)
dialog: God yes, Allie. I've gotta say --
dialog: that was the ballsiest move I
dialog: ever --
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: (ecstatic)
dialog: Holy shit. Holy --
text: He GURGLES. AN ENORMOUS GOUT OF BLOOD bubbles up between
text: his lips -- and BURSTS.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: ALLIE!!
text: His hand goes to his stomach -- and comes away bloody. He
text: looks down in genuine bewilderment.
speaker_heading: KNOX
dialog: Jesus, Vicki.
text: That quickly, he's dead. VICKI lets out an awful wail and
text: slams on the brakes. She sits there in the middle of the
text: street, POUNDING THE WHEEL, TEARS pouring down her face.
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM HARBOR - NIGHT
text: In the sky, CARTOON CHARACTERS drift lazily out to sea.
scene_heading: EXT. BROAD AVENUE - NIGHT
text: THE JOKER and his boys running like hell down the avenue,
text: past the parade. They reach the last of the floats -- the
text: one bringing up the rear -- then CLIMB ABOARD and disappear
text: through a CONCEALED HATCH.
text: WOOD SPLINTERS as the top of the float begins to ROTATE
text: mysteriously. The muzzle of a CANNON breaks through the
text: parade decorations. And one moment later...
text: A ROSE-COVERED TANK is rumbling up Broad Avenue!
scene_heading: INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT
text: BATMAN sweeps past overhead. He sees the tank, unleashes a
text: burst of LASER FIRE. It bounces harmlessly off the tank,
text: leaves a trail of SMOKING ASPHALT on the street. He swoops
text: low overhead, hits a button on his control panel as he
text: streaks OVER THE TANK and into firing range.
scene_heading: INT. TANK - THAT MOMENT
text: THE JOKER and his MEN clap hands to their ears as an EAR-
text: SPLITTING ULTRASONIC SHRIEK reverberates in the tank. The
text: JOKER screams out commands, to no avail. No one can hear
text: him. He falls on the controls, begins hitting buttons.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT
text: The TANK TURRET swings wildly. A HEAT-SEEKING MISSILE rips
text: through the night, narrowly missing the BATWING... and
text: BLOWING A HOLE in the side of a skyscraper.
scene_heading: INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT
text: THE BLAST all but knocks the BATWING out of the sky. BATMAN
text: stabilizes the plane, climbs for the clouds. When he's
text: clear of the buildings, he grits his teeth and rolls out.
dialog: He's coming back for more!
scene_heading: INT. TANK - THAT MOMENT
text: The JOKER stares at a tiny BLIP on his radar screen.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: He'll be back... he'll be back!!
scene_heading: EXT. BROAD AVENUE - ON BATWING
text: The black ultralight hurtles down Broad Avenue at full
text: speed, on a suicide mission. MISSILES streak past on either
text: side. MACHINE GUN FIRE peppers the dome of the cockpit. The
text: REAR STABILIZER WING takes a direct hit... and BURSTS INTO
speaker_heading: FLAME!
text: The BATWING, trailing thick black smoke, bears down on the
text: tank like a kamikaze plane. BOMB BAYS OPEN as BATMAN dumps
text: the last of his high explosives DIRECTLY INTO THE PATH OF
text: THE TANK. The BATWING takes a hard bounce off the top of
text: the tank and CRASHES TO THE STREET.
text: And suddenly a GAPING CHASM opens underneath the tank as
text: the bombs go off -- and BROAD AVENUE BEGINS TO SPLIT WIDE
speaker_heading: OPEN!
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT
text: BROKEN CONCRETE SLABS rain down on a SUBWAY CAR stalled in
scene_heading: the tunnel DIRECTLY BENEATH BROAD AVENUE. SUPPORT GIRDERS
text: groan and GIVE WAY as the STREET ITSELF COLLAPSES -- and
text: the front end of the TANK drops through, CRUSHING THE
text: SUBWAY TRAIN BENEATH IT!
scene_heading: EXT. BROAD AVENUE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: The rear end of the TANK projects out through the rubble. A
text: hatch pops open. The JOKER crawls out through the smoke and
text: pulls himself up to the street.
text: He's down to his last three GOONS. He points to the
text: BATWING: bent, broken, WEDGED ON ITS SIDE in the asphalt
text: SEAM running up Broad Avenue -- half in, half out of the
dialog: tunnel.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: You do him. I'm outta here.
text: The GOONS look on in dismay as the JOKER scurries off. They
text: sidestep blackened debris and move up cautiously on the
text: Batwing. Through the cockpit dome they can see BATMAN...
text: inert in his harness, beaten to a pulp, all but dead.
text: A JET OF FLAME drives them back momentarily. They reach for
text: their guns, move in warily...
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Yo.
text: The frightened GOONS turn in unison. An abrupt flurry of
text: motion -- feet and fists flying -- quick flashes of red and
dialog: green --
text: -- and THREE GOONS lie paralyzed on the street. The only
text: one left standing is a fifteen-year-old boy garbed in a
text: red-and-green aerialist's uniform... DICK GRAYSON.
scene_heading: INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT
text: BATMAN slumps at the controls. Beneath him, asphalt SHIFTS
text: and BUCKLES. The Batwing lurches to the right, drops a foot
text: or two into the tunnel. Metal braces collapse and the
text: plexiglass dome of the cockpit SHATTERS LIKE AN EGGSHELL.
text: TONGUES OF FIRE lick at his face. He's helpless, pinned in
text: place. He manages to look up -- and SEES, through a dream-
text: like haze, A HAND extended toward him:
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: HEY! COME ON!
text: And suddenly DICK is clambering down into the flaming
text: wreckage. He gets an arm around BATMAN's chest and with an
text: extraordinary effort HAULS HIM OUT OF THE BATWING.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
text: They stagger across the ruptured street. BATMAN grimaces in
text: agony. His right leg -- shattered -- is like rubber beneath
text: him. His ribs are crushed. He's barely conscious.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Now we're even, huh? Even up.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: How did you...
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: I hitched. MOVE IT!
text: DICK drags BATMAN to safety as the Batwing ERUPTS INTO
text: FLAME behind them.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: The Joker. Is he --?
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Forget it. Relax.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: ... He's mine now.
text: DICK snatches an abandoned .38 off the pavement.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
speaker_heading: DICK!
text: THE BATMAN tries to pull himself erect. The pain is
text: unendurable. His body has finally failed him.
text: He collapses on the pavement, powerless to intervene, as
text: DICK races off with murder in his eyes.
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM CATHEDRAL - NIGHT
text: A BELLTOWER's jagged spire, jutting up into the night sky,
text: piercing the moon. Down at street level, the JOKER is
text: scrambling up the marble steps at the entrance to the old
text: abandoned cathedral. He pulls a WALKIE-TALKIE off his belt.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Gotham cathedral. Come and get me.
text: HEAVY PANELED DOORS groan on tired hinges as THE JOKER
text: forces his way inside. A beat. Then DICK GRAYSON appears,
text: hot on his trail, sprinting up the steps two at a time.
scene_heading: INT. CATHEDRAL - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
text: Ancient and creepy. A huge pipe organ, shattered stained
text: glass windows, row after row of mahogany pews... all
text: forgotten, covered with dust and cobwebs. The JOKER wanders
text: about, staring at the statuary, the rusted icons.
text: DICK enters silently behind him. He kneels behind a rear
text: pew, brings up the gun, and squeezes off THREE QUICK SHOTS
text: at the JOKER. The JOKER dives, takes cover, and RETURNS
text: DICK'S FIRE. Then: silence.
text: In a crouch, groping his way along the wall, THE JOKER
text: finds what he wants: a small door opening on a wooden
text: stairway, leading to the belltower. He ducks inside and
text: starts up.
text: DICK'S GUN drops with a thud. His hand slips from the back
text: of the pew. In the second before he slumps to the floor,
text: unconscious, he sees a curious sight: a TINY BLACK NINJA
text: WHEEL, imbedded in the flesh of his leg.
text: Behind him -- framed in the arched doorway -- A RAGGED
text: BLACK GHOST begins his final unholy march down the center
text: aisle of the old cathedral.
scene_heading: INT. CATHEDRAL - BELLTOWER - NIGHT
text: A tiny stone chamber, 8'x8', open on four sides to the
text: wind. The enormous church bell has long since been removed.
text: The JOKER stands in an archway, gazing at the gargoyles on
text: the roof below. He hits a button on the walkie-talkie:
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: I'm in the belltower. Don't land.
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER - MOVING - NIGHT
text: A PILOT replies through his radio headset.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: E.T.A. two minutes. Hang on.
text: The PILOT swings the copter right in a wide, swooping arc.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWAY TO BELLTOWER - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: BATMAN. Broken, beaten, his right leg useless, he hauls
text: himself up the steps one at a time. He should be dead.
text: Dried blood cakes his face, his chest.
text: Dizzy, exhausted, his body strained to the limit, he slumps
text: against a wall to steady himself, then reaches into his
text: utility belt for a painkiller -- and forces the capsule
text: back onto his dry, swollen tongue.
text: Quaking all over, he tries to draw himself erect... and
text: TOPPLES OVER, landing with his full weight on the rotten
text: wood of the belltower stairs.
text: THE STAIRWAY COLLAPSES, turning to splinters beneath him.
text: And suddenly BATMAN finds himself DANGLING PRECARIOUSLY IN
text: MIDAIR, hanging by one hand to an upper step.
text: It would be so much easier to let go. He looks down at the
text: fragments of the shattered stairway, STILL FALLING,
text: vanishing into the dark depths of the stairwell.
text: Then he looks up. At the trapdoor. A mere six feet away.
text: His TEETH CLENCH in a monstrous grimace. AND WITH AN
text: INHUMAN EFFORT, HE HOISTS HIMSELF UP ONTO THE UPPER STEPS.
text: For a full five seconds he's blind with pain. A RAGGED
text: WOODEN SHAFT is buried in his right shoulder. Twitching,
text: trembling, he reaches up and YANKS IT OUT with his last
dialog: ounce of strength.
text: The trapdoor is a foot above his head. It could be a mile.
text: BATMAN finally realizes he's not going to make it.
text: He reaches down and rips open a Velcro seal on his utility
text: belt, revealing the strange TIMER DEVICE we saw him making
text: earlier. Before he can activate it his hand falls limply at
dialog: his side.
text: THE BATMAN is out like a light.
scene_heading: INT. BELLTOWER - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: The JOKER glances casually down at the trapdoor, wondering
text: what all the noise is about. He draws his gun, moves
text: cautiously to the trapdoor, and lifts it a few inches...
text: just enough to see the unconscious form on the stairs.
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: ... Batman?
text: No reply. The JOKER stands there and lets out a little
text: snicker. He looks out through the archway, sees no sign of
text: his rescue copter. Then -- a look of curious amusement on
text: his face -- he steps down THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR and LUGS
text: BATMAN up into the belltower.
text: He props BATMAN up against a wall. Still no sign of life.
text: The JOKER crouches beside him and -- almost tenderly --
text: pats his face.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: Batman? Batman?
text: THE BATMAN's lips part. But he's too weak to speak.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: I thought you'd be more comfortable
text: here in the belfry.
dialog: (chuckling to himself)
dialog: Before I kill you I'd like to see
dialog: who you are. Would that be okay?
text: BATMAN emits a tiny low moan. The JOKER takes it as a yes
text: and reaches over to undo his cowl.
text: BRUCE WAYNE stares up with dulled, sightless eyes. The
text: JOKER reaches into his pocket for a purple handkerchief,
text: moistens it, dabs at the caked blood on BRUCE's face.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: Oh my, aren't we pretty.
dialog: (brightening suddenly)
dialog: I know you! You're the rich boy!!
text: The JOKER is enormously tickled by this discovery. He claps
text: his hands together in sheer glee.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: My goodness, what in the world made
dialog: you do it? It must've been
dialog: something pretty terrible!
text: He's practically dancing now. He's made a friend.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: You know, we should've sat down and
dialog: had us a little heart-to-heart. I
dialog: bet we would have got on famously.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Mad... man...
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Well now, you're not exactly the
dialog: picture of mental health, are you.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: ... Murderer...
speaker_heading: JOKER
dialog: Bruce, we're both murderers. Think
dialog: how many people you've killed by
dialog: letting me live.
text: A SPOTLIGHT cuts through the night sky. The JOKER hears his
text: helicopter approaching in the distance.
text: BRUCE reaches down furtively. Finds the timer on his
text: utility belt. FLICKS A SWITCH... and the countdown begins.
text: The JOKER pulls a straight razor from his pocket and opens
text: it gingerly.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: I have to do it now, Bruce, but it
dialog: won't even hurt. Now relax. The
dialog: bat's in his belfry, all's right
dialog: with the world...
text: He has the razor almost up to BRUCE's throat when BRUCE
text: reaches out and GRABS HIS LAPELS in a death grip. The JOKER
text: is momentarily amused by this seeming display of affection.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: Why, Bruce...
text: Then he hears ticking.
text: Looks down at the flashing digital display on BRUCE's belt.
dialog: 0:26 seconds. 0:25 seconds.
text: He SHRIEKS HORRIFICALLY and DROPS THE RAZOR.
text: BRUCE won't let go of him. Finally he manages to lurch
text: convulsively away, sprawling on the floor of the belfry.
text: BRUCE is wearing a great big Joker smile.
speaker_heading: JOKER (cont.)
dialog: IT'S NOT FUNNY!!!
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: No... sense... of humor?
text: The JOKER reaches out for the ticking time bomb. Thinks
text: better of it and retracts his shaking hand.
text: He can see the copter approaching now, slicing through the
text: clouds. He screams, waves a flashlight in the air: his
text: signal beacon. 0:20 and counting.
text: The JOKER scans the belltower frantically. His eyes fall on
text: the trapdoor. He races over, flings it open, starts down
text: the stairs in a frenzy.
text: There are no stairs. They've collapsed. 0:16 and
dialog: counting.
text: Screaming insanely, the JOKER vaults through the door and
text: makes for the open stone archway. The copter is directly
text: overhead now. A rope ladder drops from its belly.
scene_heading: EXT. BELLTOWER - THAT MOMENT

scene_heading: INT. BELLTOWER

scene_heading: EXT. BELLTOWER
text: A maelstrom of swirling leaves. And now, among the leaves
text: -- roused from their resting place in the rotten rafters of
dialog: the old cathedral --
text: -- A HORDE OF SQUEALING, CHITTERING BATS!! Filling the air
text: like a black cloud, HUNDREDS OF THEM, taking flight in

scene_heading: INT. BELLTOWER
text: The JOKER leaps into empty space, grabs hold of the ladder,

scene_heading: -- WHO SCREAMS IN TERROR -- LETS GO OF THE LADDER --

text: TIGHT ON BATMAN. Six seconds remain. There is still time if
text: he makes his choice now.
text: Surrounded by the flapping of leathery wings, his body
text: working on pure adrenalin, he unbuckles the belt. Lurches
text: into position. Heaves it out into the darkness.
text: It snags on the bottom rung of the dangling rope ladder.
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER - POV CO-PILOT

scene_heading: EXT. CHURCHYARD - OVERHEAD ANGLE
text: It's as if time has stopped. The world has grown suddenly
text: silent. We're looking down at the JOKER, whose body lies
text: splayed and broken on the flagstone surface of the
dialog: churchyard. Slowly, elegantly -- we have all the time in
text: the world, now -- we DRIFT DOWNWARD, closer, until his FACE
text: FILLS THE SCREEN, the familiar chilling grin still intact.
text: Sad clown, A-one crazy boy, staring aimlessly at the stars.
text: Suddenly his face is bathed in a brilliant gasoline GLOW.
speaker_heading: POV JOKER
text: Looking up he sees a beautiful display of fireworks,
text: bursting and burning, spirals of color snaking through the
text: sky as the helicopter explodes in eerie silence.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE - THE JOKER'S FACE
text: It's all so lovely. The JOKER's expression is happy, almost
text: childlike, as he gazes up at this private show. Gradually,
text: though, the bright colors fade; and the JOKER's face begins
text: to relax, the twisted grin dissolving at last as darkness

scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I loved you too.
text: As soon as the words come out, she begins to CRY. Then she

speaker_heading: VICKI

speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (taking her hand)
dialog: Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or

speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I guess you did it, didn't you. You
dialog: saved everyone.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Almost.
text: For a moment he stares deeply into her eyes. Then he pulls

speaker_heading: BRUCE

speaker_heading: BRUCE

scene_heading: 49 INT. BANK OF GOTHAM - NIGHT 49

speaker_heading: TWO-FACE
text: Right on schedule.
text: Two-Face's men scramble to the hole, attach chains to...
scene_heading: 50 EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 50

text: FOLLOW THE CHAIN UP as it yanks tight, revealing...

speaker_heading: TWO-FACE
text: At last, The Bat dies!

speaker_heading: TWO-FACE

text: The Thugs and Harvey all whirl, machine guns coming up,

text: THE GUARD lays bound on the floor. Suddenly a clamp-ended

text: The skylight overhead EXPLODES and, in a rain of glass,
text: Batman drops to the floor on a Batrope.
text: 58 THE GUARD is apparently attached to the Batrope's other 58

scene_heading: 60 EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 60
text: The Thugs come leaping through the hole, using the now
text: rising safe as a springboard to close the windy gap, roll
text: to safety on the construction site next door. They
text: scatter, begin scaling various beams and girders.
scene_heading: 61 INT. BANK 61
text: Swat Teams race through the smoke in close pursuit, come
text: up short at the edge of the urban precipice. The safe has

text: cops drop, begin FIRING across the gap. Suddenly...
text: A DARK WING explodes out of the smoke behind them, flying
text: across the abyss.
scene_heading: 62 INT. CONSTRUCTION SIGHT 62
text: A Thug fires at the figure hurling towards him. Batman

scene_heading: 63 REVERSE ANGLE 63

text: 65 BATMAN - POV. A motorized gantry is carrying one of the 65
text: Thugs up to the roof.
text: 66 Batman FIRES a Batarang. The bat-shaped clamp bites into 66
text: the wooden base of the rising gantry.
text: He toggles the launcher into winch mode, is hoisted fast
text: towards the rising gantry above.
scene_heading: 67 ON THE GANTRY 67

scene_heading: 68 ON THE BATROPE 68
text: The Thug slides fast down to kicking range, draws back
text: his boot to dispatch Batman.
text: Batman hits a switch on his launcher, increasing the

text: Thug's foot in his hand, shoves him up so his head CRACKS
text: against the bottom of the gantry. Batman swings the
text: unconscious Thug onto a hanging construction hook,
text: leaving him dangling in mid-air by his nose ring, hoists
dialog: himself up onto...
speaker_heading: 69 THE GANTRY 69
text: From the scaffolding above, a Thug drops to one end of

text: Behind Batman, another Thug drops INTO FRAME, drawing a

text: Batman reaches forward, grabs the Thug's spinning nun-

text: 73 Batman jumps, drops through the abyss between the two 73

text: 74 A HIGH TENSION WIRE - CLOSE. The wire bends like a bow, 74
text: shooting Batman like an arrow straight into the air.
text: 75 Batman grabs the rising chain, slides down it's links so 75
text: he is standing atop the safe.
text: 76 He FIRES a Batarang into the bank wall, making an anchor, 76
text: attaches the Bat-cable to the hitch atop the safe.
scene_heading: 77 INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT 77
text: The chopper is straining against Batman's bank-embedded

speaker_heading: TWO-FACE
text: The man is taking his job
dialog: _much too seriously_.
scene_heading: 78 EXT. TOP OF SAFE - NIGHT 78
text: Batman palms a compartment on his utility belt and a

text: into his gloved hand.
text: A BLUE FLAME ignites. Batman starts to cut the chains.
scene_heading: 79 EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT 79
text: Batman's torch slices the last link. Batman reaches up
text: and grabs the winch chain, is jerked suddenly upward with
text: the now un-tethered chopper as...
speaker_heading: 80 THE SAFE 80
text: now freed, swings like a pendulum on it's anchor line,
text: arcing straight for the hole in the bank wall from which
dialog: it was originally drawn.
scene_heading: 81 INT. BANK BUILDING 81

scene_heading: 82 INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT 82

scene_heading: 84 EXT. GOTHAM SKY - NIGHT 84

scene_heading: 85 EXT. ARKHAM SQUARE - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING 85
text: Gotham's Times Square. Tall. Narrow. The crawl of bumper-

text: life as the city rushes past.
text: 87 A SERIES OF SHOTS as street folks look up in wonder. 87
text: 88 SIGN - CLOSE. For Ginsu Knives. A couple of giant hands 88

text: The chopper swings Batman _through_ the ad, falling blades
text: just missing him, dragging him through the thick smoke.
text: The chopper swings across the square, heading for...
text: 89 ANOTHER SIGN - CLOSE. This time a tremendous set of 89
text: clacking teeth turn yellow to white each time the cap
text: lifts off of a giant tube of toothpaste.
text: 90 The chopper barrels straight for the opening mouth. 90
text: At the last moment the chopper banks, whipping the
text: dangling Batman inside the mouth.
text: 91 The mouth closes on the Caped Crusader. 91
text: 92 The chopper pulls away, the chain pulling like floss 92
text: through the closed teeth.
scene_heading: 93 INT. MOUTH 93

scene_heading: 94 EXT. ARKHAM SQUARE - MOUTH SIGN 94

scene_heading: 96 INT. CHOPPER 96
scene_heading: TWO-FACE'S POV - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

scene_heading: 99 INT. HELICOPTER 99
text: As the Pilot, in the b.g. regains control of the chopper,

speaker_heading: TWO-FACE
dialog: Ah, to finally be rid of that pointy

scene_heading: 100 THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD 100

speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Uh...boss....

speaker_heading: PILOT

scene_heading: 101 EXT. HELICOPTER 101

scene_heading: 102 INT. HELICOPTER 102

speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Harvey, you need help. Give it up.
scene_heading: 103 EXT. HELICOPTER 103

speaker_heading: TWO-FACE
dialog: Words of wisdom from our ex-friend?
text: Harvey SLAMS Batman's face with his foot. He goes down.
speaker_heading: TWO-FACE
dialog: Mano a Mano a Bato.

text: him to the floor. Drags him half way out of the bird.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Surrender.
speaker_heading: TWO-FACE
dialog: Ever been to Arkham, Batman? You'd
dialog: feel right at home. You took a year

speaker_heading: BATMAN

text: Batman gets Harvey by the throat.
speaker_heading: TWO-FACE
dialog: Batman doesn't kill? Bullshit.
dialog: (epiphinous)
dialog: You're a killer too.
text: Somehow Harvey's words seem to shake Batman a beat. It's
dialog: all the distraction Harvey needs. He SMASHES Batman

text: Batman slips, falls out of sight.
text: 104 WINDSHIELD - CLOSE. Lady Gotham is coming up fast. 104
scene_heading: 105 EXT. HELICOPTER 105

scene_heading: 106 INT. HELICOPTER 106

speaker_heading: TWO-FACE
dialog: Goodbye old pal.

speaker_heading: STICKLEY

scene_heading: 125 STICKLEY - POV - As far as Fred is concerned he's on the 125

speaker_heading: ALFRED

dialog: fighter or criminal?
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: How 'bout Two-Face? Anyone here
dialog: heard of him?
text: The shot WIDENS to reveal the panel.
scene_heading: 146 ON SCREEN - Our first expert: DR. JANISLAUS ROYCE. 146
speaker_heading: ROYCE
dialog: Batman is a major cause of crime in
dialog: Gotham. So-called super-villains
dialog: seek him out hoping to prove
dialog: themselves in violent conflict.
dialog: Batman does not deter crime, he
dialog: invites it.
speaker_heading: VONDELLE
dialog: I'm sure our audience objects to
dialog: your gender bias. Batperson.
text: The second expert PIPES in, DR. DAVID AIMS.
speaker_heading: AIMS
dialog: What is the Dark Knight's credo?
dialog: Batman does not kill? What of those
dialog: slain during his fight with Jack
dialog: Napier aka Joker? Or in his
dialog: Christmas conflict with the orphan
dialog: Cobblepot? Batman belongs behind
dialog: bars, not his morally disadvantaged
dialog: victims.

text: 148 Watching, Bruce sits a little straighter, more hopeful. 148
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I could like this woman.
speaker_heading: 149 CHASE 149
dialog: Batman is a _reaction_ to the crime in
dialog: this city, not a creator of it!
dialog: Without him many more would be dead.
dialog: Batman is a true hero...
speaker_heading: VONDELLE

scene_heading: WIDEN TO REVEAL
text: Two-Face's hideaway, divided straight down the middle.
text: Lace's half is all light and order. Leather's domain
text: looks like an S&M club.
speaker_heading: TWO-FACE
dialog: Too many bats to fry to think about
dialog: fun. We wanna take him apart limb by
text: hyper-extended limb. Feel his bones
dialog: crunch in our hands. Beat him until
dialog: he's as black and blue as that
text: ridiculous rubber suit.
text: Without thinking, Harvey steps over the Laceland. His
text: demeanor instantly changes, now more reasoned and calm.
speaker_heading: TWO-FACE
dialog: On the other hand, perhaps something
text: slow, a delicious incursion of
text: despair, a campaign to shatter his
text: psyche and bring him crumbling to
text: his knees.
text: He wanders back across to Leatherland.
speaker_heading: TWO-FACE
dialog: Hell. Why wait? Rupture his organs.
text: Shatter his spine. Still have time
dialog: for a late dinner.
text: Back in Laceland.
speaker_heading: TWO-FACE
dialog: But simple murder? It's just too
dialog: damn simple. Besides, it's been
dialog: done. No. We need a plan.
text: Back to Leatherland.
speaker_heading: TWO-FACE
dialog: Yes. Something senseless, brutal,
text: savage, violent.
dialog: Back to Laceland, stopping to add...
speaker_heading: TWO-FACE
dialog: Yet witty.

speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: A few hitches sir, but I'm confident

speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: If I misinterpreted your interest in

speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I wonder if she'd go out with me.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Apology hastily retracted.
text: Bruce freezes the image of Vondelle Williams over the
dialog: familiar graphic: Batman: Crimefighter or Criminal?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: They don't understand. They think I
dialog: became Batman to fight crime.
text: Bruce leans back, closes his eyes, his past never far.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Do you remember the night I fell
text: into that cave and the bat chased
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Your parents' wake. Rain fell like
dialog: tears.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: ...The night Batman was born.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: What was I doing in the fields that
dialog: night, Alfred? What sent me running
dialog: out into that storm? I keep dreaming
dialog: about it but I just can't remember.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I don't know, sir. Your dear
text: parents. Suddenly gone. So much
dialog: loss...
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I remember the bat, though. His
dialog: scream. Those eyes. i was sure the
dialog: fear would kill me.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: In time I came to believe that if I
dialog: became a monster, that if I was
dialog: feared, I wouldn't be scared
dialog: anymore. I was wrong.
dialog: (off the screen)
dialog: They think I became Batman to fight
dialog: crime. I became Batman to fight the
dialog: fear. And instead I became the fear.
text: Alfred hands him an envelope.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Perhaps it's time you paid a bit

speaker_heading: EDWARD

scene_heading: MRS. LUCERTOLA

speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Yes. TV. Balm to the minds of the

text: He hits a switch on the Box and the familiar beam engulfs

scene_heading: 162 MRS. LUCERTOLA - POV - She might as well be sitting on the 162

speaker_heading: EDWARD

speaker_heading: CHASE

speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Wacko? That a technical term?
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Patient apparently suffers from

speaker_heading: BRUCE

speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: That's a rorschach, Mr. Wayne.

speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: I think the question would be, do

speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: What do you know about obsession?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Not much.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Obsession is born of fear. Recall a
dialog: moment of great terror in your life.
dialog: Say you associate that moment
dialog: with...
dialog: (random)
text: ...a bat. The bat's image becomes a
dialog: cancer of the mind, grows more real

speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: It's a stretch but I'll manage.
speaker_heading: CHASE
text: The letter writer is obsessed with

speaker_heading: BRUCE

speaker_heading: CHASE

speaker_heading: BRUCE

speaker_heading: ALFRED

speaker_heading: DICK

speaker_heading: ALFRED
text: Ninety-three, including the sauna.
speaker_heading: BRUCE

text: 238/39 But Dick isn't listening, stares instead over 238/39
text: Bruce's shoulder as Gordon's cruiser disappears out of
dialog: sight.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Okay. I'm outta here.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Excuse me.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: I figure telling that cop I'd stay

dialog: no offense but thanks. See ya.
text: Dick heads toward the door. Alfred slips away.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Where will you go? The circus is
text: halfway to Metropolis by now.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: I got no place at the circus without
dialog: my family. I'm going to get a fix on
dialog: Two-Face. Then I'm going to kill
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Listen, Dick. Killing Two-Face won't
dialog: take the pain away. It'll make it
dialog: worse.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Look, spare me the sermons, okay.
dialog: You're just some rich guy who is
dialog: trying to do a good deed. You don't
dialog: even know me.
text: Bruce stares beyond Dick, into his own past.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: It's not just the sadness. Is it?
dialog: The shame is worse. Feeling like
dialog: somehow you should have saved them.
text: Dick is looking at Bruce now.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: You're right. I don't know you. But
dialog: I'm like you.
text: Just then Alfred returns with a tray. Rare London broil.
text: Baby potatoes. Fresh greens. An aromatic feast.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Oh, is the young master leaving?
dialog: Pity. I'll just toss this away then.
dialog: Perhaps the dogs are hungry -
text: Alfred turns, heads up the stairs.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I'll set this up in the guest suite.
dialog: Just in case.

scene_heading: 240 INT. - WAYNE LIBRARY 240
text: Bruce touches a vase of fresh roses. Stares at framed

dialog: With no knowledge of the future.
text: 241 He turns. Suddenly their coffins are in the middle of the 241

speaker_heading: ALFRED (OVER)
dialog: Master Bruce?

text: the images only flashes of memory. Night has fallen. He
text: looks up, eyes. red.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: It's happening again. Just like my
text: parents. A monster comes out of the
text: night. A scream. Two gunshots. I
dialog: killed them.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: What did you say?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: He killed them. Two-Face. He
dialog: slaughtered that boy's parents.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: No. You said I. I killed them.
speaker_heading: BRUCE

speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Commissioner...?
text: A shadow appears from behind the searchlight. Chase.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: He's home. I sent the signal.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Last night at the circus. I noticed
dialog: something about Dent. His coin. He's
dialog: obsessed with justice. It's his
dialog: Achilles' heel. It can be exploited.
text: He steps close to her. Intimidating.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: You called me here for this? The
text: Batsignal is not a beeper.
text: Instead of backing off, Chase moves towards him.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: I wish I could say my interest in
dialog: you was purely professional...
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Are you trying to get under my cape,
dialog: Doctor?
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: A girl cannot live by psychoses
dialog: alone.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: It's the car, right? Chicks love the
dialog: car.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: What is it about the wrong kind of
dialog: man? In grade school it was guys
dialog: with earrings. College, motorcycles
text: and leather jackets.
text: Chase is right up against him. She runs her fingers along
text: the outline of Batman's mask.
speaker_heading: CHASE
text: Now black rubber.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Try a fireman. Less to take off.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: I don't mind the work. Pity I can't

text: Batman stills her hand.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: We all wear masks.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: My life's an open book. You read?
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: I'm not the kind of guy who blends
text: in at a family picnic.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: We could give it a try. I'll bring
dialog: the wine, you bring the scarred
dialog: psyche.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: You are direct, aren't you?
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: You like strong women. I've done my
dialog: homework. Or do I need skin-tight
dialog: vinyl and a whip?
text: Their bodies are close.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: I haven't had much luck with
dialog: women...
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Maybe you just haven't met the right
dialog: woman...
text: Their mouths are close. Suddenly Commissioner Gordon,
text: trench-coat over pajamas, rushes onto the roof.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: I saw the beacon. What's going on?
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Nothing... False alarm.
text: 251 Batman shoots a Batarang into the night and dives from 251

scene_heading: VOICE IN THE DARK
dialog: The answer is, your enemy.
speaker_heading: TWO-FACE
dialog: Who are you?
scene_heading: VOICE IN THE DARK
dialog: You can just call me... The Riddler.
text: The figure steps out of shadow. A new costume, lime
text: green, covered with question marks, an emerald eye mask,
text: derby and cane. An exact replica of the Guesser's outfit.
speaker_heading: TWO-FACE
dialog: How'd you find us?
speaker_heading: RIDDLER
dialog: You _are_ Two-Face, you would need to
text: face both rivers, both uptown and
text: downtown simultaneously. Only one
dialog: spot in Gotham serves these bi-
dialog: zonal, bi-coastal needs...
speaker_heading: TWO-FACE
dialog: Congratulations. You get to die on

text: Two-Face trains his gun, COCKS the trigger.
speaker_heading: RIDDLER
dialog: Has anyone ever told you have a
dialog: serious impulse control problem?
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: You know, I simply love what you've
dialog: done with this place. Heavy Metal
dialog: with just a touch of House and
dialog: Garden.
text: He crosses to Leatherland.
speaker_heading: RIDDLER
dialog: It's so dark and Gothic and

text: He moves to Laceland.
speaker_heading: RIDDLER
text: Yet so bright and chipper and
dialog: conservative!
dialog: (to "bad" side)
dialog: It's so you.
dialog: ("good" side)
dialog: And yet so _you_!
dialog: (touching his suit)
dialog: Very few people are both a summer
dialog: _and_ a winter. But you pull it off
dialog: nicely.
speaker_heading: TWO-FACE
text: A man with a death wish.
speaker_heading: RIDDLER
dialog: Harvey. You need me. Since you've
dialog: gotten out of Arkham, you've
dialog: managed, what? To bungle stealing a
dialog: safe? Wreck a statue? And, correct
dialog: me if I'm wrong here, but weren't
dialog: you outsmarted by an acned acrobat
dialog: at the circus?
speaker_heading: TWO-FACE
dialog: Let's see if you bleed green.
text: Two-Face COCKS back the hammer.
speaker_heading: RIDDLER
dialog: Alright, counselor. Go ahead. Fire
dialog: away. But before you do, let me ask
dialog: you one question. Is it really me
dialog: you want to kill?
text: The Riddler knits his thumbs together, waves his hands
text: over one of the exposed light bulbs that illuminate the
text: room, making a shadow on the wall. The shadow of a bat.
speaker_heading: RIDDLER
dialog: Do you know about hate, my dual
dialog: visaged friend? Slow, burning hate
dialog: that keeps you sleepless until late
dialog: in the night, that wakes you before
dialog: dawn. Do you know that kind of hate?
dialog: I do.
dialog: (circling Harvey)
dialog: Kill him? Seems like a good enough
dialog: idea. But have you thought it
dialog: through? A few bullets, a quick
text: spray of blood, a fast, thrilling
dialog: rush, and then what? Wet hands and
dialog: post-coital depression. Is it really
dialog: enough?
dialog: (up close)
dialog: Why not ruin him first? Expose his
text: frailty. And then, when he is at his
dialog: weakest, crush him in your hand.
text: 255 Riddler gestures to the front of the room, where Leather 255
text: and Lace, on their respective sides, are fixed to their
text: TV's via the green beam of the box.
text: He tosses a receiver electrode to Two-Face.
speaker_heading: RIDDLER
dialog: ...Take a hit.
text: Two-Face looks at the electrode curiously.
speaker_heading: RIDDLER
dialog: (taps his forehead)
dialog: Up, up, up.
text: A beat. Then, gun still trained on the Riddler, Two-Face
text: holds the receiver to his skull. He's blasted with a dose
text: of Leather and Lace's neural energy.
speaker_heading: TWO-FACE
dialog: Holy shit.
speaker_heading: RIDDLER
dialog: So not everyone can be a poet.
dialog: Still, I respect the sentiment.
text: Riddler waves his hand in front of the girls' eyes. No
text: response. Definitely zoned.
speaker_heading: RIDDLER
dialog: (to the girls)
dialog: This is your brain on the box.
dialog: (off Harvey)
dialog: This is your brain on their brain.
text: He plants an electrode on his own forehead.
speaker_heading: RIDDLER
dialog: This is my brain on your brain on
dialog: their brain. Does anybody else feel
dialog: like a fried egg?
text: The Riddler grabs Two-Face's receiver.
speaker_heading: TWO-FACE
dialog: No. Wait...
speaker_heading: RIDDLER
dialog: Addictive isn't it? Just Say No.
dialog: Until I say yes. A little fringe
dialog: benefit of working with me. Now
dialog: here's the concept, counselor.
dialog: Crime. My I.Q., your AK-47. You help
dialog: me gather production capital so I
dialog: can produce enough of these
dialog: (pulling a Box from his vest)
dialog: to create an empire that will
dialog: eclipse Bruce Wayne's forever. And,
dialog: in return I will help you solve the
dialog: greatest riddle of all. Who is
dialog: Batman?
text: Two-Face eyes The Riddler, interest dawning in his eyes.
speaker_heading: TWO-FACE
dialog: You are a very strange person. You
dialog: speak as if we are old friends,
dialog: which we are not. You barge in here
dialog: unarmed when it is clearly suicidal
text: to do so. Still, an intriguing
dialog: proposition.
dialog: (pulling his coin)
dialog: Heads: we take your offer.

speaker_heading: TWO-FACE
dialog: Riddler. You punch like a girl. Put

speaker_heading: RIDDLER

text: Riddler sits atop a tremendous electronic throne, facing
text: a wall bank of TV monitors all running newsreel footage

speaker_heading: RIDDLER
dialog: Be my guest.

speaker_heading: TWO-FACE
dialog: Our Paleolithic yearnings are best
dialog: expressed in a pre-linguistic-
dialog: (off the befuddled girls)
dialog: Sorry. Just thinking out loud.
text: Harvey leans back, buzzed, the electrode slipping from

speaker_heading: RIDDLER
dialog: (to Leather)
dialog: Not until you do that thing I like.
dialog: (taking a hit)
dialog: On se tue pour des mesnonges. J'ai

speaker_heading: TWO-FACE

speaker_heading: TWO-FACE

speaker_heading: RIDDLER

speaker_heading: AIMS

speaker_heading: VONDELLE

speaker_heading: ALFRED

dialog: Master Dick?
text: High above, Dick appears on the third floor landing.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Up here, Al.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Just checking, young sir.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Four seconds from...
text: Below, Alfred opens the door.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Now!
text: Alfred disappears inside and the door begins to close.
text: Dick leaps the bannister, grabs the chandelier, swings to

text: the door SLAMS shut.
scene_heading: 298 INT. SECRET HALL 298
text: Unable to stop, Dick barrels through a dark doorway,

scene_heading: 300 INT. CHASE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 300
text: Big. Open. A life still in boxes. The door opens,
dialog: producing Bruce and Chase.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: The style of the letters I'm getting
dialog: matches those found at the crime
dialog: sites. Why would The Riddler be
dialog: sending me riddles?
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: Who's your decorator? U-Haul?
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Sorry. I haven't even had time to
dialog: unpack. Instant coffee okay?
text: Chase disappears into the kitchen as Bruce takes off his
text: coat. She reappears with a small box. Hands it to Bruce.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What's this?
text: Bruce opens the box. Within, a dream doll.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Call it clinical intuition. I
dialog: thought your dreams might need
dialog: changing.
text: Bruce looks at Chase. He stares out the window a beat,
text: deciding. As he speaks now his words are halting, self
dialog: disclosure difficult for him.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: My parents were murdered. In front
dialog: of me. I was just a kid.
text: Chase nods. She knows.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: A lot of what happened is jagged.
dialog: Pieces missing. I can't really
dialog: remember. I just get flashes.
dialog: Usually in my dreams. I'd kind of
dialog: gotten used to them. At least
dialog: accepted them....
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: And now....
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: They've changed. The dreams, I mean.
dialog: There's a new element I don't
dialog: understand. A book. Black. Covered
dialog: in leather....
text: (OVER) The kettle begins to WHISTLE.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Damn. I'll be right back.
text: Bruce is agitated, starts to looking around. At her desk
text: he finds a virtual shrine to Batman. Pictures.
dialog: Newsphotos. Articles.
speaker_heading: CHASE (OVER)
dialog: Find anything interesting?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Why do I feel like the other man,
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Come on, Bruce. This is what I do
dialog: for a living.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I'd say this goes a little beyond
dialog: taking your work home.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: What do you want me to say? That I'm
dialog: not attracted to him?
text: 301 She hits a button and on screen newsfootage rolls of 301
text: Batman fighting Catwoman.
speaker_heading: 302 CHASE 302
dialog: (mesmerized)
dialog: Look at the abuse he's taking. He's
dialog: not just fighting criminals. He's
text: punishing himself.
text: Chase hits a button, freezing on Batman's face.
speaker_heading: CHASE
text: It's as if he's paying some great
dialog: penance. What crime could he have
dialog: committed to deserve a life sentence
dialog: of such agony?
text: Bruce hits a key, blanking the screen.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Maybe he just had a lousy childhood,
dialog: is that it Doc?
text: Chase grabs his hand as it comes away from the keyboard.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Why do you do that?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Throw up that ridiculous superficial
dialog: mask. If you're jealous...
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I'm not-
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: You want me close but you won't let
dialog: me near. What's the terrible, dark
dialog: secret you're protecting everyone
dialog: from?
text: In the mirror they are half in shadow, half in light.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: In a sense we are all two people.
dialog: The side we show in daylight. And
dialog: that side we keep in shadow.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Rage. Anger. Passion. Pain.
text: He pulls her to him. Their faces are close. A breath
text: apart. Suddenly his watch begins to BEEP.
text: 303/04 Bruce turns over his wrist. Depresses a stud on 303/04
text: his watch. The face turns into a screen.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Sorry to bother you, sir. I have
dialog: some rather distressing news about
dialog: Master Dick.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Is he all right?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone
dialog: traveling.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: He ran away?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Actually, he took the car.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: He boosted the Jag?
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: Is that all?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Not the Jaguar. The _other_ car.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: The _Rolls_?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: _No_, sir. _The_ _other_ _car_!
text: A beat. Then Bruce closes his eyes.
scene_heading: 305 EXT. ARKHAM SQUARE - NIGHT 204
text: Gotham night life. Neon, traffic, sleaze.
text: The Batmobile cruises into the center of the strip.
text: A group of flashy low riders pull in front of the
text: Batmobile. They hydraulic up and down competitively.
text: The Batmobile wipers sweep the windshield. The bat-foil
text: opens and closes. Finally the car hydraulics higher and
text: faster, but a bit wildly, the driver barely in control.
text: 306 The low riders, put to shame, PEEL OUT. (OVER) A SCREAM 306
text: cuts the night. A GIRL runs for her life, chased by SIX
text: GANG MEMBERS into a dark alley.
text: The Batmobile TEARS after her.
scene_heading: 307 EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT 307
text: The Thugs have the Girl surrounded, push her back and
text: forth between them like a rag doll.
text: The Batmobile SCREECHES into the alley. The door slides
text: open. From the smoking hatchway emerges...Dick.
text: Needless to say, this get the Thugs' attention. They let
dialog: go of the girl.
speaker_heading: THUG
dialog: Who the hell are you?
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: (low, ominous)
dialog: I'm Batman.
dialog: (looking down)
dialog: Damn, did I forget to dress again?
text: The Thugs close. One rushes Dick while another swings a
text: chain at his head. Mistake.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Chains. You don't seem like the
dialog: type.
text: Dick's hand shoots out fast, grabbing the chain. He open
text: palms the Thug in the chin, whips the chain into the gut
dialog: of the other villain.
speaker_heading: DICK
text: The Caped Crusader strikes again.
dialog: Sans cape, of course.
text: Two more rush him.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Another victory for the Dark Knight.
text: Dick goes up with a flying front kick, knocking one down,
text: fells another on the return with a spinning back fist.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: (off the unconscious goons)
text: Dark nighty-night.
text: Dick stares at the remaining thug. Smiles.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Is your will up to date?
text: The last Thug takes a look at Dick, turns and races away.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: I could definitely get behind this
dialog: super hero gig.
text: Dick nods to the awestruck Girl.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Ma'am.
text: He starts towards the car.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Wait.
text: She moves close.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: You forgot the part where you kiss
dialog: the girl.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: Right.
text: He leans in, happy to oblige when suddenly...
text: (OVER) SCREAMS AND SHOUTS as the Thug who got away comes
text: racing back into the alley, followed by maybe thirty new
text: gang members, all wielding bats and chains.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Uh-oh.
text: He pulls the girl behind him, readies for war.
scene_heading: 308 A DARK FIGURE 308
text: flies out of the night.
text: Batman, on a wire, swings into the group, sending them
text: scattering in all directions. The bad guys race off.
scene_heading: 309 THE BATMOBILE 309
text: REVS UP, races to Batman.
text: 310 Batman lifts Dick by his collar, drops him into the 310
text: passenger seat. Hops into the other side.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Don't you want my number?
text: She watches as the Batmobile speeds away into the night.
scene_heading: 311 INT. BATCAVE - NIGHT - LATER 311
text: Bruce and Dick argue.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: I need to be part of this.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Absolutely not.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Me and my brother Chris were putting
dialog: money aside so our folks could
dialog: retire. Dad's knee was going. Chris
dialog: was engaged, you know that? Two-Face
dialog: took...everything. Now I can pay him
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What I do isn't about revenge.
text: Dick glances at a framed headline. The Wayne murders.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Right, slick. Whatever you say.
text: Bruce grabs him. Hard.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: This isn't a game.
text: Dick pushes him off. Harder.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Back off, man.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: You don't understand. It's an
dialog: addiction. You fight night after
text: night, trying to fill the emptiness.
text: But the pain's back in the morning.
dialog: And somewhere along the way it stops
dialog: being a choice.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: I want better for you.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Save the sermons about how great you
dialog: want my life to be, okay, Bruce? If
dialog: it weren't for Batman my parents
dialog: wouldn't be dead. You don't get it,
dialog: do you? This is all your fault.
text: Dick storms out. Bruce stares after him with tired eyes.
scene_heading: 312 EXT. RITZ GOTHAM HOTEL - NIGHT 312
text: At the marble entrance, the red carpet is rolled out for
text: a pull-out-the-stops party. Over the door, a banner
dialog: proclaims "Nygmatech -- Imagine the Future."
text: At the curb folks dressed in over-the-top runway
text: fashions, pour from luxury cars, hand off keys to a
text: battalion of scurrying valets.
text: Next car up -- Bruce Wayne's Rolls, driven by Alfred. A
text: valet helps Chase out. She looks stunning.
text: Bruce leans over Alfred before stepping out of the car.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Too much wealth. Too fast. Half of
text: Gotham zombied-out. A technology
text: that self destructs. He's protecting
dialog: more than industrial secrets,
dialog: Alfred.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I shall be near at hand. Should you
dialog: need me. And sir, I know it's
dialog: difficult but try and have a good
dialog: time.
scene_heading: 313 INT. RITZ GOTHAM ROOF - NIGHT 313
text: Over the top golden glitz. A kind of Versailles meets
text: punk meets couture. And in the middle, Edward, dressed as
dialog: Louis XIV.
text: The room is packed with people sipping exotic cocktails,
text: munching hors d'oeuvres. Conversation BUZZ is high.
dialog: Into this zoo walk Bruce and Chase.
text: As brightly-lighted stations throughout the room, showy
text: displays announce "THE NEW BOX". Pretty, barely-clad
text: showgirls invite partygoers step into various green
text: columns of light.
text: 314 Bruce scans the room as he and Chase pause by the first 314
text: display, where a Socialite steps into a column of energy.
text: She GASPS with delight as she finds herself suddenly
text: dazzling in diamonds from head to toe.
text: 315 They pass the next column where a CHUBBY PROFESSOR, sword 315
text: in hand, fights off a knight on horseback.
text: 316 They pass the next display where a BALD GUY steps into a 316
text: beam. Suddenly, he is in a classic stoner's pad circa
text: 1967. And, best of all, he has long flowing hair.
text: Chase looks amused, Bruce suspicious.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: If I didn't know better, I'd say you
dialog: were sulking.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your
dialog: fees are a little rich for me.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Touchy, touchy.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (not biting)
dialog: So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit
dialog: of Batman?
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (flaring)
dialog: Spare me the diagnosis, okay? You're
dialog: being ridiculous. I can't be jealous
dialog: of Batman.
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Can I?
scene_heading: 317 ACROSS THE ROOM 317
text: Edward stands flanked by Gotham's Society Matrons as
text: PRESS, including Vondelle Millions, SNAP photos and hurl
dialog: questions.
speaker_heading: NEWSCASTER
dialog: You're outselling Wayne Enterprises.
dialog: Any comments?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Actually, I'm outselling Wayne Tech
dialog: two to one...
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: The Times has named you Gotham's
dialog: bachelor of the year. What do you
dialog: have to say about that?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: You might want to ask Bruce Wayne.
dialog: (calling)
dialog: Bruce, old man!
text: 318 Edward crosses the room to greet Chase and Bruce. All 318
text: stand now, surrounded by press and partygoers.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: So glad you could come.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What? Oh, Edward. Hi.
dialog: Congratulations. Great party-
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: The press were just wondering what
dialog: it feels like to be outsold,
text: outclassed, and generally outdone in
dialog: every way...
dialog: (noticing Chase)
dialog: And what light through yonder window
dialog: breaks? `Tis the east. And you
dialog: are...
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: (charmed)
dialog: Chase?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Of course you are. And what a grand
dialog: pursuit you must be.
dialog: (to Bruce)
dialog: What do you think of my new
dialog: invention?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What? Oh, it's very impressive.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
text: Gracious even in defeat. How vaguely
dialog: disappointing. When all this could
dialog: have been ours together.
text: Edward stills a passing waiter and his tray of champagne.
text: Crystal flutes for all. He toasts Chase.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: No grape could be more intoxicating
dialog: than you, my dear. But we make due.
dialog: To your charms.

dialog: Skol.

speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: I'm drinking.
dialog: And she does.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I notice you've sub-divided your B
text: coupons. Feeling a little light on
dialog: principle?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Actually, I like to divest just
text: before a major re-capitalization.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I wouldn't race to the bank. Old
dialog: regimes crumble every day. Life is
dialog: a cycle. Remember Yeats; turn, turn
text: the widening gyre. The Falconer
dialog: cannot hear the Falcon...
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (finishing the poem)
text: And the beast slouches towards
dialog: Bethelem.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Excuse me, boys. I'd hate to stop
dialog: this testosterone flood on my
dialog: account-
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Quite right. Shall we dance?
text: And with that, Edward draws Chase onto to dance floor.
text: 319 As Chase and Edward dance in the b.g. Bruce walks over to 319
text: one of the displays. Examines a control station for the
text: green beam. Tries to pry open a circuit panel.
speaker_heading: SHOWGIRL (OVER)
dialog: Naughty, naughty.
text: She slaps his hand playfully. Bruce smiles an apology.
text: Looks around. No other choice. He steps into a beam.
text: 320 EDWARD twirls Chase, watches Bruce enter the beam. He 320
dialog: smiles.
text: 321 BRUCE - POV. Colorful planets soar all around him. Suddenly 321
text: the beam flashes. There, racing towards him, a giant Bat.
scene_heading: 322 BACK TO SCENE 322
text: All beams wink out as GUN FIRE bursts across the room.
text: TWO-FACE and his Thugs stand at every entrance.
text: BRUCE backs away, slips towards a service door.
speaker_heading: TWO-FACE
dialog: Alright, folks, this is an old-
dialog: fashioned, low-tech stick-up. We're
dialog: interested in the basics: jewelry,
dialog: cash, watches, high-end cellular
dialog: phones. Hand 'em over nice and easy
text: and no one gets hurt.
text: Two-Face's Thugs charge the room. The crowd SCREAMS.
scene_heading: 323 EXT. RITZ GOTHAM ALLEY - NIGHT 323
text: Bruce hand-slides down fire-escapes, hits the alley
dialog: running.
scene_heading: 324 EXT. ALLEY 324

speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Emergency, Alfred.
scene_heading: 325 INT. ROLLS 325
text: A secret panel in the back opens. A Batsuit.
scene_heading: 326 INT. PARTY 326
text: The Thugs circulate quickly, yanking jewels from ears and
text: necks, grabbing wallets and purses, filling sacks.
text: Ed pushes his way against the crowd, through Two-Face's
text: ring of personal guards and right up to Two-Face's face.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: You're ruining my big party. Are you
dialog: insane? Actually, considering your
dialog: dual persona, let's just forget the
dialog: question.
speaker_heading: TWO-FACE
dialog: We're sick of waiting for you to
dialog: deliver The Bat, Riddle boy. You
dialog: promised us Batman.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Patience, oh bifurcated one.
speaker_heading: TWO-FACE
dialog: Screw patience. We want him dead.
dialog: (looking around)
text: An nothing brings out The Bat like
text: a little mayhem and murder.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Oh well, in that case. As long as
dialog: you were going to rob me, you could
dialog: have at least let me in on the
dialog: caper. We could have _organized_ this,
dialog: _planned it_, pre-sold the movie
dialog: rights.
text: (OVER) the CRASH of breaking glass.
speaker_heading: 327 BATMAN 327
text: flies in through a window, kicking a row of Thugs down
text: before he lets go his rope and lands on the floor.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Harv, babe, I gotta be honest. Your
dialog: entrance was good. His was better.
dialog: What's the difference? Showmanship.
text: Two-Face shoves Edward away, looking for a clean shot. He
text: FIRES a couple of times, but only destroys an ice
text: sculpture and some liquor bottles. More SCREAMS.
text: 328 One huge Thug charges Batman. Batman heaves him overhead, 328

speaker_heading: VONDELLE (OVER)
dialog: Batman, Batman, Batman help!

speaker_heading: BATMAN (OVER)
dialog: Excuse me.
text: He head-butts the Thug. The guy goes down.

text: The chemistry here is undeniable.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Call me.
text: Batman spins, goes for another group of Thugs.
scene_heading: (OVER) POLICE SIRENS.
speaker_heading: TWO-FACE
dialog: Okay boys. Phase two.

text: A wide spiral staircase of scaffolding hugs the walls of

text: The Thugs race down the steps, knocking out bits of
text: scaffolding as they go, sending entire chunks of already
text: traversed staircase plummeting past them.
speaker_heading: PAN UP
text: Batman arrives on a wide platform of scaffolding at the
text: top of the staircase. His cape whips up around him as if
text: from some low infernal wind.
text: 337 BATMAN - POV. Down the fragmenting staircase, at the bottom 337
text: of the shaft, a tremendous fan spins, chewing chunks of
text: falling scaffolding and plaster, spitting plumes of dust.
speaker_heading: 338 TWO-FACE 338

speaker_heading: 339 THE PLATFORM 339

text: 340 BATMAN - POV. The giant whirling blades, coming up fast. 340
text: 341 BATMAN falls, stairways and laughing Thugs whipping past. 341
text: His hand shoots out and grabs
speaker_heading: A THUG
text: by the jacket, wrenching the fabric over the goon's head,
text: jerking him hard into the railing like a human anchor.
text: Batman climbs the struggling Thug like a ladder, leaps
text: onto the staircase, CRACKS the Thug's head on the rail,
text: then races down the stairs.
scene_heading: 342 BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT 342
text: The remaining Thugs disappear through a dark doorway.
text: Batman runs past the BEATING fan blades into...
scene_heading: 343 INT. ABANDONED TUNNEL 343
text: Dark. Steep and sloping. The Thugs are running dead
text: ahead. Without stopping they begin grabbing pieces of
text: debris, flip them under their feet, begin riding down the

text: Batman races after them.
scene_heading: 344 THE SNOWBOARDERS 344
dialog: really are good. They ride the rails. The low gas pipes.

text: 345 A THUG - CLOSE. Looks back to see Batman closing. Mistake. 345
speaker_heading: WHIP PAN
text: as he is clotheslined by a low hanging danger sign. He

text: Batman races past him.
text: 346 The end of the tunnel slopes so drastically the dark maw 346
text: at the end seems more a pit than a door.
text: 347 The boarders circle and one by one, drop through like 347

dialog: Years ago this cavernous space glistened with immense

dialog: No more.
text: Now the giant space, from floor to ceiling is a frozen
text: maelstrom of twisting cast iron trusses, broken steam
text: pipes, fragmented scaffolding and hanging cables.
text: 350 Down these man-made slopes and obstacles ride the 350
text: snowboarding Thugs. Cruising pipes. Jumping curved faces
text: of statues. Jacking from scaffold to truss.
text: 351 Batman whips a pair of nun-chucks from his belt over a 351
text: hanging metal rail, using the chain as a pulley, shoots
text: down a curving rail into the mad dance of twisting steel.
speaker_heading: 352 A THUG 352
text: FIRES at him from his whizzing board as it careens along
text: an adjacent piece of scaffolding.
text: 353 BATMAN angles towards him, picking up speed. 353
text: 354 THE THUG banks off some statuary. Takes a few more SHOTS. 354
text: 355 BATMAN shoots around the curve, jumps from one rail to 355
text: the next, catches the villain in the face with his boot,
text: and sends him flying.
text: 356 ANOTHER THUG shoots past over head. 356
text: 357 BATMAN flips onto another pipe, is closing fast, chasing 357
text: the Thug towards a loop that banks towards the blackness
text: of an abandoned tunnel.
text: He is closing on the Thug. Closer. Closer.
text: 358 Suddenly the Thug, hops to a truss, the rail Batman is on 358

speaker_heading: 359 TWO-FACE 359

speaker_heading: TWO-FACE

scene_heading: main. AN EXPLOSION.
text: Suddenly a tremendous secondary EXPLOSION. Debris falls
text: everywhere as the gas ignites, the mouth of the tunnel
text: suddenly brightening into a flaming white fireball.
scene_heading: 365 INT. TUNNEL 365
text: The huge fireball rushes towards Batman. Batman wraps

text: 366 HAND - CLOSE. As he reaches to his utility belt. Presses a 366
dialog: stud there.
text: 367 His cape begins to run and flow like water morphing into 367

scene_heading: 369 INT. MOUTH OF TUNNEL 369

speaker_heading: 370 REVERSE ANGLE 370

text: The Bat heads towards Two-Face and his men.
scene_heading: 372 TWO-FACE - CLOSE. Consumed with rage. 372
text: He grabs a section of the wall's support scaffolding
text: and begins to wrench it free with crazed fury.
speaker_heading: TWO-FACE
dialog: Why won't you just die?!
text: In a final rage of maniacal fury, Harvey wrenches the

speaker_heading: 373 THE CEILING 373
text: begins to crack and fall, debris pouring in at an ever

text: BATMAN is suddenly doused in a rain of rock and sand.
speaker_heading: 374 THE TUNNEL 374

text: 377 BATMAN stumbles as the ground beneath him suddenly gives, 377

text: He reaches for his utility belt but its too late.

speaker_heading: TWO-FACE
dialog: Boys, let's go have us a party.

speaker_heading: WIDER

scene_heading: DICK - CLOSE. Straining.

speaker_heading: DICK

speaker_heading: DICK

speaker_heading: BRUCE

speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask

speaker_heading: BRUCE

speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
text: At the french doors to her bedroom stands a familiar

text: Chase rises, moves across the room, the pale light

text: THE KISS - CLOSE. Passionate. Sustained. Chase pulls away.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: I'm sorry.
dialog: (sorry)

speaker_heading: CHASE

dialog: But... I hope you can understand.

speaker_heading: TWO-FACE
dialog: You know, Ed, we woke up this
dialog: morning, we just knew we were gonna
text: kill something. The Bat got away.
dialog: Looks like it's gonna be you.
text: Two-Face draws his gun with his free hand. Trains it on
text: Riddler's head. By the look in his eyes, he's serious.
speaker_heading: TWO-FACE
dialog: Why do we need you? You only come
dialog: between us. We can be the smartest

speaker_heading: RIDDLER
dialog: Kill me? Well, alright. Go ahead.

speaker_heading: RIDDLER

dialog: Would you not then own that man?

speaker_heading: RIDDLER
dialog: A few dozen extra IQ points and my
dialog: little invention learned a new

speaker_heading: RIDDLER
dialog: Would you like to see what my old

speaker_heading: RIDDLER

dialog: Bruce. Alfred told the police your
dialog: father always kept it on his desk.
dialog: But the day after the murders, it
dialog: was gone. Maybe that's the book

speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I always thought it was the bat that

speaker_heading: TWO-FACE

text: CHASE SCREAMS as Thugs grab her.
text: BRUCE hits the floor. Hard. No movement. None at all.
speaker_heading: TWO-FACE
dialog: Bruce, you sure know how to throw a

speaker_heading: RIDDLER (OVER)
dialog: Sheath your weapon my impetuous

speaker_heading: TWO-FACE

speaker_heading: RIDDLER
dialog: Oh yes, and certainly _WE_ will!
text: Riddler walks over to the unconscious Wayne. Kneels.
text: Looks at him, tender, like a lover. Caresses his face.
speaker_heading: RIDDLER
dialog: My poor sweet hero.
text: He stands, kicks him hard in the rib cage. Bones CRACK.
speaker_heading: RIDDLER
dialog: We'll kill him alright. But first...

speaker_heading: DOCTOR

text: Alfred ushers him out, returns to Bruce's bedside.
speaker_heading: ALFRED

speaker_heading: ALFRED

speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: As well as can be expected, I guess.

speaker_heading: ALFRED

speaker_heading: BRUCE

scene_heading: 421 EXT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS ROOFTOP 421

speaker_heading: ALFRED

speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: There's one other thing. I feel..
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BRUCE

speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a

speaker_heading: BRUCE

speaker_heading: ALFRED

scene_heading: 425 INT. BATCAVE 425
text: Bruce stands before a dark, rocky mouth. Through this

text: shifting world of shadow.
text: Bruce steps inside.
scene_heading: 426 INT. INNER BATCAVE 426
text: FAVOR BRUCE as he walks deeper into the darkness. The
text: walls around him undulate, as if covered in water.
text: 427 WALLS - CLOSER. The movement isn't water at all. It's the 427
text: restless shrugging of bats. Thousands of bats.
text: 428 Bruce presses on. Sweat beads on his face. 428
text: Ahead, a diffusion of moonlight illuminates a curving
text: rock chamber, bats here too bringing the walls to life.
text: Bruce moves into the moonlight. Looks up.
text: 429 BRUCE - POV. A narrow chute. The fall he took as a child. 429
text: He kneels, there on the floor, worn by years of weather,
text: a single book. A diary.
text: Bruce kneels, touches the leather cover, fingers
text: lingering for a moment on his father's embossment, before
text: he turns yellowed pages to the last entry. Painfully, by
text: moonlight, he reads.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (OVER)
dialog: (dreaded confirmation)
text: Bruce insists on seeing a movie
dialog: tonight...
text: He pauses, gathers himself. He continues.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (OVER)
dialog: But Martha and I have our hearts set
dialog: on Zorro, so Bruce's cartoon will

text: Bruce stares at the book in disbelief. Then he looks up
text: at the moonlight, tears streaming down his face.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: ...Not my fault. It wasn't my fault.
text: 430 Suddenly, in the darkness ahead, a dark shape moves, head 430
text: rising, slits opening to reveal two blood red eyes.
text: The giant monarch bat spreads its wings, huge, as it
text: rises, suddenly airborne, rushing toward him.
text: 431 BRUCE - CLOSE. And terrified. He turns to run. The bat's 431
text: flapping wings BEAT like drums, closing fast.
text: Bruce holds his ground. Resolved. He turns and faces the
text: monster, SCREECHING towards him, glistening fangs barely
text: inches from his face.
text: Something remarkable happens. The bat holds its
text: position, stares into Bruce's eyes, wings spreading wide.
text: A beat. Then Bruce raises his arms, a living mirror. The
text: two stand facing each other, man and bat. In the moon-
text: light on the wall, their shadows begin to blend, to
text: merge, becoming one _SHIMMERING WHITE LIGHT!_
scene_heading: 432 INT. BATCAVE 432
text: The mouth of the inner cave. A sudden SCREAMING DIN as a

text: life and there, from within, steps a man.
speaker_heading: 433 REVERSE ANGLE 433
text: ALFRED stands at the entrance.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Master, Bruce?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: ...Batman, Alfred. I'm Batman.
scene_heading: 434 EXT. NIGHT SKY 434
text: The Batsignal shines. Suddenly the air above the familiar
text: circle begins to shimmer and glow, becoming...
text: A giant green question mark. The Batsignal itself is now
text: just the small period at the symbol's bottom.
scene_heading: 435 INT. BATCAVE - NIGHT 435
text: Bruce stands at the ruined control platform. Riddles are
text: spread before him. Including the most recent.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
text: All the answers are numbers.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What do maniacs always want?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Recognition, of course.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Precisely. So this number is
text: probably some kind of calling card.
text: Bruce stares at the numbers. Adds them: 18. Squares them:
text: 1916425. No luck. Starts again, separating them: 13/18/5.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
text: Letters in the alphabet.
speaker_heading: ALFRED

speaker_heading: BRUCE

speaker_heading: ALFRED

speaker_heading: BRUCE

speaker_heading: BRUCE

dialog: I'm sure that's where they're

dialog: (realizing)

speaker_heading: ALFRED

speaker_heading: DICK (OVER)

speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Dick... Where did you get that suit?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I...um..took the liberty, sir.
speaker_heading: DICK

speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: For my mother.

speaker_heading: DICK

speaker_heading: RIDDLER

speaker_heading: BATMAN

speaker_heading: RIDDLER

speaker_heading: BATMAN

scene_heading: 508 THE BATARANG 508

speaker_heading: 515 BATMAN 515

speaker_heading: CHASE

speaker_heading: BATMAN 2
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - DUSK
text: It's finally happened. Hell's frozen over.
text: Christmas is two weeks off, arid SNOW is falling in Gotham.
text: Beneath its pristine white blanket, the city looks
text: uncharacteristically serene -- almost inviting. Peace has
dialog: been miraculously restored: strangers wave hello. Salvation
text: Army Santas ring their bells on streetcorners. And now, as
text: night falls, an ILLUMINATED SIGN winks on above Broad Avenue:
scene_heading: "JOYEUX NOEL GOTHAM -- Only 16 Shopping Days Left Till
dialog: Christmas."
text: The streets are bustling with jolly shoppers. At a souvenir
text: store, we find an exasperated MOM squabbling with her seven-
text: year old. Like many other storefronts in Gotham, this one is
text: overflowing with bootleg BATMAN MERCHANDISE: t-shirts, key
text: chains, ceramic figurines. The kid is already wearing a
text: Batman baseball cap and a little black cape, but he obviously
dialog: wants more.
text: Mom drags him off past another store window, this one full of
text: SCRAP METAL, with a sign reading "AUTHENTIC FRAGMENTS OF THE
text: BATWING -- $19.95 and up." A PANHANDLER is perched at the
text: entrance. Beneath his array jacket is a grubby sweatshirt
text: with the familiar yellow-and-black logo. In Gotham this
dialog: winter, Batmania is everywhere...
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Two hours later, the SNOWSTORM's grown into a full-fledged
text: blizzard. The drifts are two feet deep and the streets are
text: all but empty of cars. A massive SNOW PLOW the size of a
text: Panzer tank rumbles past, FILLING THE FRAME...
text: ...and revealing, as it passes, a group of CAROLERS, all
text: bundled up in mufflers and parkas. Unbothered by the weather,
text: they walk the street singing, spreading cheer and goodwill to
text: the few passersby.
text: They've just gone into a lovely <i>a capella</i> rendition of "Silent
text: Night" when an oversized DELIVERY TRUCK, outfitted with snow
text: chains, clanks slowly past in the wake of the plow. Its sides
text: are decorated with cartoon igloos advertising a popular ice
text: cream snack -- POLAR BARS -- oddly inappropriate for this time
dialog: of year.
text: A streetcorner SANTA, with bell and bucket, WAVES at the truck
text: as it rounds a corner. The CAROLERS carol. Then --
text: -- a VIOLENT EXPLOSION rocks the street -- followed by the
text: sound of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE and a high, wailing SECURITY ALARM.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHRACH AND CO. - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: Around the corner there's CARNAGE on the streets. The windows
text: have blown out of Gotham's leading jewelry store. Gut-shot
text: SECURITY GUARDS stagger and go face down in the snow as
text: ROBBERS, dressed in white camouflage gear, clamber out through
text: the shattered glass with SACKFULS OF LOOT.
text: CAROLERS spill around the corner to see what's going on, but a
text: spray of GUNFIRE sends them scattering in panic. The POLAR
text: BAR truck pulls even with the jewelry store, and as it does...
text: The REAR DOORS open. A RAMP slides down from the back of the
text: truck. The ROBBERS scramble aboard, and mere seconds later
text: SLIDE out AGAIN -- riding atop five SKIDOO SNOWMOBILES.
text: SIRENS HOWL. A POLICE CAR appears, taking the corner just a
text: trifle too fast -- FISHTAILING on the icy street and plowing
text: into a drift.
scene_heading: INT. SQUAD CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: The COPS gun the engine, but their wheels are spinning in the
text: snow -- no traction. They're about to climb out and give
text: chase on foot when, through the windshield, they see the
dialog: Salvation Army SANTA...
text: ...HOISTING AN AK-47 AND FIRING DIRECTLY AT THEM. The
text: windshield disintegrates and the COPS sink from view as SANTA
text: races off to the last of the snowmobiles, which is already
text: burdened with LOOT.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: MORE SQUAD CARS converge on the jewelry store -- but it's
text: difficult to carry on a high-speed pursuit when the snow's a
dialog: foot deep and the best you can do is 6 MPH. The COP CARS skid
text: to a halt, blocked by the rumbling SNOWPLOW. By now, of
text: course, the LOOTERS are gone -- scooting off on either side of
text: the plow, sticking to the snowy sidewalks.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
text: SNOWMOBILES glide across the sidewalks, sending the few hardy
text: souls who are out on the streets DIVING FOR COVER. A couple
text: of DERELICTS are cowering behind a fire hydrant, trying to
text: avoid getting run over. Every time they poke their heads out,
text: another SKIDOO whizzes past, missing them by inches.
text: The ROBBERS fan out in various directions. These guys are
dialog: obviously going to get away clean -- unless...
text: The DERELICT points up at the night sky, where a BEACON is
text: blazing in the darkness -- THE BLACK SILHOUETTE OF A BAT...
scene_heading: INT. POLICE CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: MORE SIRENS. A COP takes a radio call as he streaks down the
text: long wide avenue which borders Gotham Park -- one of the few
text: streets which is relatively clear. The COP at the wheel goes
text: wide-eyed and nudges his partner in disbelief.
text: Before their eyes, FIVE SNOWMOBILES appear from the cross
text: streets up ahead and CONVERGE at the entrance to Gotham Park.
text: Bringing up the rear is SANTA CLAUS.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: What the hell -- ?
scene_heading: EXT. ENTRANCE TO PARK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: BRAKES SQUEAL. Several squad cars are now massed at the
dialog: entrance to the park -- but there's one problem. The city's
text: snow plows don't operate on the park roads -- and the entrance
text: is blocked off with SAWHORSES reading "CLOSED TO TRAFFIC." A
text: huge steep drift prevents them from entering -- and so all
text: they can do is stand by helplessly, WATCHING as the
text: snowmobiles vanish into the trees.
text: The COPS race about like headless chickens, trying to concoct
text: a plan. A couple of them are trying to scale the stone walls
text: of the park. Another is at his car, barking into a radio
dialog: mike:
scene_heading: COP WITH MIKE
dialog: Yeah, you heard me. Snowmobiles!
dialog: <i>(pause)</i>
dialog: So what do we do? Chase 'em on foot??
text: ALL EYES TURN at the blare of a horn. The COPS peer down the
text: long corridor of the cross street -- and see a STRANGE BLACK
text: VEHICLE barreling toward them at 90 MPH, with no intention of
dialog: stopping...
text: THE BATMOBILE!! COPS dive left and right. A split-second
dialog: later...
text: ...a FORTY-FOOT JET of NOVA-INTENSITY FLAME erupts from the
text: front of the jet-black supercar -- instantaneously DISSOLVING
text: the drift that blocks the entrance to the park -- turning the
text: ice and snow on the paths before it into water!
text: The BATMOBILE screams past in the wink of an eye. The COPS
text: get to their feet; cold as it is, they're sweating. One of
text: them mops his brow and announces, dumfounded:
speaker_heading: COP I
dialog: ...That was Batman.
speaker_heading: COP II
dialog: NO SHIT!!
text: COP II yanks COP I into the nearest squad car, and the others
text: follow suit. ENGINES REV. As long as the BATMOBILE's cleared
dialog: a path, they might as well join in the chase...
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDLE PATH - THAT MOMENT
text: TWO BURLY TEENAGERS -- both dressed in RED BERETS and PARKAS
text: with BLACK BATMAN SWEATSHIRTS visible underneath -- are
text: trudging along the path when they're STARTLED by a pair of
text: speeding SKIDOOS. Moments later, they spot a RED GLOW on the
dialog: horizon...
text: ...and their JAWS DROP as the BATMOBILE roars into view,
text: BURNING OFF THE SNOW IN ITS PATH. Thrilled beyond words, they
text: WHOOP WITH GLEE, slapping high-fives as the car streaks past.
scene_heading: INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT
text: His face is weirdly illuminated by the flame still spitting
text: from the front of the car. Cool as ever -- approaching the
text: chase as a simple problem in logic -- he checks a radar
text: display on his dashboard and sees FIVE BLIPS.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK - ON SQUAD CARS - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: The cops follow along in BATMAN's path. The lead car LOSES
text: CONTROL and plows headlong into a drift. The DRIVER jams the
text: pedal, but his rear wheels end up digging a deep rut in the
text: ice. He sits there cursing, pumping the accelerator as other
text: COPS race past him on foot.
scene_heading: INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN
text: The various ROBBERS have spread out, their vehicles BOUNDING
text: over the hilly terrain of the park. He spots two of them up
text: ahead; as he draws closer, they PART WAYS, veering off to the
dialog: left and right...
scene_heading: ANGLE ON BATMOBILE - MOVING
text: PODS OPEN on the front fenders, and MISSILE LAUNCHERS rotate
text: into place. The Batmobile fires a pair of HEAT-SEEKING
text: TORPEDOS, which BURROW into the snow on either side and
dialog: disappear.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON LEFT SNOWMOBILE - MOVING
text: The DRIVER looks back over his shoulder and sees what appears
text: to be a BLACK SHARK FIN plowing through the snow behind him,
text: GAINING FAST. He takes evasive action, but the SHARK FIN
text: always seems to follow. Just as he approaches the crest of a
dialog: hill...
text: ...the TORPEDO slams into the rear of the SNOWMOBILE. The
text: force of impact knocks the ROBBER cleanly off. His LOOT lands
text: in the snow beside him, but the SNOWMOBILE keeps going --
text: sailing over the crest of the hill and striking the rocks
text: beyond with a deafening EXPLOSION.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON RIGHT SNOWMOBILE - MOVING
text: This ROBBER's a little smarter than his buddy. When he sees
text: the shark fin on his tail, he noses his snowmobile off into a
text: GROVE OF TREES. The trees are too closely spaced for the
text: torpedo to maneuver; it strikes the nearest tree trunk and
text: explodes harmlessly.
text: The ROBBER is feeling good about himself, because the
text: Batmobile can't follow either. But BATMAN has a Plan B. As
text: he drives alongside the grove, he HITS THE ACCELERATOR,
text: passing the snowmobile on its left. A STEEL SPIKE attached to
text: a cable launches from the side of the Batmobile and WEDGES
text: ITSELF into a distant TREE.
text: The cable goes taut, and the tree TOPPLES -- directly into the
text: path of the second SNOWMOBILE. The vehicle crashes into the
text: trunk, and the hapless ROBBER goes cartwheeling head-over-
text: heels into a drift.
text: In the distance, COPS appear -- racing to the scene on foot,
text: ready for mop-up duty. BATMAN kills the flamethrower, hits
text: the brakes, and FISHTAILS, doing a quick 180 on the snow.
text: He's just spotted fresh quarry: snowmobiles three and four,
text: whizzing over a rolling white pasture in the distance.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK - THAT MOMENT
text: We're at a makeshift CAMPSITE -- where a cluster of HOMELESS
text: PEOPLE are burning refuse in a garbage can to keep warm. They
text: look on in puzzlement as the two SNOWMOBILES whiz past and
text: disappear over a crest of a hill...
scene_heading: EXT. LAKEFRONT - ON SNOWMOBILES #3 AND #4
text: They bounce down the hillside and SKID -- arriving at the edge
text: of a frozen-over LAKE. With the roar of the Batmobile behind
text: them, the two DRIVERS get the same idea simultaneously.
text: Smiling, they rev their engines and set out over the surface
dialog: of the lake.
text: Now the Batmobile crests the ridge. The car's weight tips
text: suddenly and it begins to skid down the hill toward the lake.
text: BATMAN sees what's happening and kills the flamethrower just
text: in time -- but he can't brake the car on the snowy slope. The
text: prow of the Batmobile slides out onto the edge of the lake --
text: -- and under its weight, the ICE begins to crack. The left
text: front tire takes a sudden dip -- and worse yet, the car is
text: sliding forward.
scene_heading: INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN
text: He shifts frantically from drive to reverse, trying to rock
text: the car out of its predicament, but his rear wheels find no
text: purchase. He can hear the ice cracking beneath him.
text: Grimacing, he throws a switch on the dashboard --
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - ON BATMOBILE
text: -- and the trunk pops open. An industrial-strength GRAPPLING
text: HOOK shoots upward and digs in at a point beyond the crest of
text: the hill; and a concealed WINCH ASSEMBLY begins to grind away,
text: hauling the Batmobile uphill, out of danger.
scene_heading: INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN
text: Suspended just above the icy lake, he sees the SNOWMOBILE
text: vanishing into the distance. He opens (yet another) panel on
dialog: the dashboard...
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - ON SNOWMOBILES #3 AND #4
text: The ROBBERS give each other a big thumbs-up. They're almost
text: halfway across the lake now and the Batmobile is disabled.
text: All at once they hear a strange WHISTLING overhead...
text: Fireworks? No, it's a THERMITE BOMB -- rocketing past them,
text: hitting the ice some forty feet ahead and EXPLODING GAUDILY.
text: JAGGED CHUNKS OF ICE break free and SHIFT in the frigid water
text: -- and the ROBBERS are skidding into the drink before they
dialog: know what's hit them.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON SNOWMOBILE #5 - MOVING
text: The last of the robbers is SANTA CLAUS -- his big sack filled
text: not with toys, but precious stones. He approaches the edge of
text: the park, negotiating his way through a maze of rocky
text: outcroppings. He squirts out from behind a boulder into a
dialog: clearing...
text: ...and GASPS in PANIC as a SEARING BURST OF FLAME erupts
text: behind him. The BATMOBILE speeds out from the other side of
text: the boulder; SANTA twists his accelerator, desperately trying
dialog: to build up speed.
text: As it is, he's barely managing to stay ahead of the
text: flamethrower. But the jet of flame suddenly DIES; the HOOD of
text: the Batmobile rises half a foot --
text: -- and TWIN PROJECTILES launch into the air. A heavy NET is
text: strung between them -- and it lands SMACK ON TOP OF SANTA
text: CLAUS, entangling the snowmobile and stopping him in his
dialog: tracks.
text: Immobilized, he watches through the net in horror as the
text: Batmobile barrels down. When the great black machine is
text: almost atop him --
text: -- it stops on a dime six inches from his heavily-padded
dialog: frame.
scene_heading: EXT. ENTRANCE TO PARK - A MINUTE LATER - NIGHT
text: The COPS are spread out near the entrance. They've rounded up
text: the other ROBBERS and returned most of the loot. They hear a
text: dull ROAR in the distance...
text: ...and a few seconds later the BATMOBILE streaks into view,
text: dragging the NET behind it -- SANTA, his loot, and his
text: snowmobile, all tied up in one tidy parcel.
text: At the entrance to the park, the NET detaches itself from the
text: Batmobile, dumping SANTA into the hands of the waiting COPS.
text: Without stopping, the BATMOBILE roars out of the park and
text: vanishes whence it came. A mildly-humiliated COP turns to his
speaker_heading: colleague and SHRUGS:
speaker_heading: COP I
dialog: ...Merry Christmas.
text: The second COP points to SANTA, still struggling in the net.
speaker_heading: COP II
dialog: Gift-wrapped and everything.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CITY HALL - DAY

speaker_heading: GORDON
text: After a high-speed chase -- over $750,000
dialog: in precious jewels were recovered intact

dialog: crowd:
scene_heading: VOICES IN CROWD
text: TAKE BACK THE STREETS! TAKE BACK THE
text: STREETS! TAKE BACK THE --
text: GORDON winces and lets out a sigh. The CHANTERS are a group
text: of pugnacious, well-muscled KIDS, late teens and early
text: twenties, all dressed in identical garb: black Batman
text: SWEATSHIRTS and little red Guardian-angel BERETS. They're
dialog: obviously members of the same club -- just like the guys we
text: saw in the park.
text: GORDON waits for them to shut up, but they don't; so he grabs
text: the mike and speaks slowly and distinctly, trying to be heard
text: over the din.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: I would like to stress -- that while this
dialog: city enjoys a special relationship with
dialog: Batman --
dialog: <i>(louder)</i>
dialog: -- we do not condone vigilantism --
dialog: <i>(practically screaming)</i>
scene_heading: -- IN ANY FORM.
text: It's no use. He's totally drowned out by the RED BERETS, who
text: continue to shout and shake their fists. Giving up, he
text: returns the mike to a REPORTER and marches up the steps in a

dialog: Hey, lady -- we're out here on patrol
dialog: riskin' our necks to protect old biddies
dialog: like you.
dialog: <i>(into mike)</i>
dialog: If this lame-o Gordon could do his job --
text: MORE CATCALLS from the crowd. The picture jumps suddenly as a
text: minicam is jostled; some sort of SCUFFLE appears to be
text: breaking out. Before it does, CAMERA PULLS BACK from the TV
dialog: screen, placing us in:
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: where ALFRED THE BUTLER is watching the Sekowsky interview
text: with extreme dismay. As he trims the crusts from a pair of
text: hearty watercress sandwiches, he SLICES HIS FINGER OPEN.
text: ALFRED makes a pained face -- it's all Sekowsky's fault.
text: Onscreen, the fracas continues; SEKOWSKY has recommandeered
dialog: the mike...
speaker_heading: SEKOWSKY (on TV)
dialog: We're provin' that the spirit of Batman is
dialog: alive in this city. We're gonna take back
dialog: the streets!
text: SEKOWSKY raises a fist. Behind him, his CRONIES begin to
text: chant: "TAKE BACK THE STREETS! TAKE BACK THE STREETS!"
text: Incensed, sucking on his finger, ALFRED moves to the TV and
text: flicks it off.
text: He turns on the radio in search of something more soothing.
text: "Good King Wenceslas" pipes through the manor; smiling, ALFRED
text: sets the sandwich plate alongside a steaming kettle on a
dialog: Sterling silver tea service.
scene_heading: INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: The CAROL CONTINUES UNDERNEATH as ALFRED, white linen draped
text: over one forearm, sets the tea tray down on his master's big
text: mahogany desk. He digs in his pocket for a key and unlocks a
text: side drawer.
text: The drawer contains a stack of yellowed, aging NEWPAPER
text: CLIPPINGS -- among them one which reads "THOMAS WAYNE
text: MURDERED: Prominent Doctor, Wife Slain in Robbery.
text: Unidentified Gunman Leaves Child Unharmed." ALFRED digs
text: around beneath the clippings and finds a concealed SWITCH at
text: the rear of the drawer.
text: Gears grind, and a sectional bookcase detaches itself from the
text: wall -- sliding out a couple of feet to reveal a STONE
text: STAIRWAY which descends into darkness...
scene_heading: INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
text: Descending the stone stairs, ALFRED arrives in the Batcave.
text: "Good King Wenceslas" is on the speakers down here as well.
text: Across a catwalk the BATMOBILE rests on its little plateau,
text: wrapped in a tarp.
text: ALFRED clears some space on a lab table and sets the tea
text: service down. He glances up at the bank of video monitors and
text: sees SEKOWSKY, still babbling, on several channels
text: simultaneously. He scans the cave, but there's no trace of
speaker_heading: BRUCE.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Sir? -- MASTER BRUCE??
text: As if in response, BATS screech and flutter in the distant
text: recesses of the cavern. ALFRED turns suddenly and sees BRUCE
text: behind him, suspended from a thin filament wire, RISING OUT OF
text: A BOTTOMLESS ABYSS.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I'm not deaf, Alfred. I hear you.
text: He's wearing his civvie -- tweed pants and cashmere sweater --
text: but he's got the utility belt, with its spring-action reel,
text: buckled about his waist. Clutching a bundle, he hangs in
text: midair for a moment, dangling over the void. ALFRED slowly
text: regains his composure:
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I took the liberty of preparing tea.
dialog: <i>(indicating tbe monitors)</i>
dialog: I take it you've been watching the news?
text: BRUCE, still dangling, glances up at the SEKOWSKY interview
text: and nods.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Yeah...lot of crazy people in this world.
text: BRUCE rocks back and forth to build up momentum. He kicks off
text: on the nearest stone outcropping, lands gracefully on the
text: Batcave floor, and unbuckles his belt. Preoccupied, he drops
text: his mysterious bundle on the lab table: a roll of black
text: fabric, and a cluster of lightweight, hollow ALUMINUM RODS,
text: connected by what appears to be SURGICAL TUBING.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I should inform you...Christmas is
dialog: approaching, and we've received our annual
text: solicitation from the Fireman's Toy Fund.
dialog: <i>(eyeing the equipment)</i>
dialog: If I may inquire...?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Oh, yeah. Watch this.
text: BRUCE hits a trigger on a tiny gas canister attached to the
text: tubing. The tubing inflates and the rods spring erect --
text: stiffening, wing-like, into something which looks remarkably
text: like the skeleton of an umbrella.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Most ingenious, sir. What exactly <is> it?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What does it look like?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: To the untrained eye, sir, it looks
dialog: remarkably like...the skeleton of an
dialog: umbrella.
text: Sounds good. BRUCE eyes his new invention, thinks it over,
text: smiles slyly.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Good guess, Alfred. That's exactly right.
text: BRUCE hits the trigger, and the rods WILT with a hiss. He
text: sits at his lab table; ALFRED unfolds a napkin on his lap,
text: pours a cup of tea.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Splendid, sir, and if I may say, I'm glad
dialog: you're putting your time to such
dialog: productive use.
dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: Now -- the Toy Fund. Our contribution
dialog: last year was a half-million dollars...
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: We can do better than that.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Then there's the foster-parents program...
dialog: the Gotham homeless crusade...
text: BRUCE nods abstractedly and tucks into his sandwich. He seems
text: oddly preoccupied -- not exactly melancholy, but his thoughts
text: are obviously a million miles away. ALFRED looks on,
dialog: concerned:
speaker_heading: ALFRED (cont.)
dialog: Is something troubling you, sir?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Yeah...the holidays, I guess. Always gets
dialog: me thinking about...
dialog: <i>(he changes the subject)</i>
dialog: And to tell you the truth, I'm a little --
dialog: concerned about Vicki.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: <i>(anxiously)</i>
dialog: Miss Vale, sir...?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Yeah. I've been thinking about it lately.
dialog: Thinking about it a lot...
dialog: <i>(gravely; shaking his head)</i>
dialog: ...and I still can't figure out what to
dialog: get her for Christmas.
text: BRUCE shoots ALFRED a solemn, perplexed look -- and ALFRED
text: heaves an audible sigh of relief as we
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PRISON CELL - DAY
text: TIGHT ON a stack of COOPS and CAGES, piled high against a bare
text: concrete wall. Each cage -- and there are at least two dozen
text: of them -- contains a twittering BIRD: starlings, pigeons,
dialog: cardinals, titwillows...
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK from the bars of the cages to reveal a VERY
text: ODD FIGURE in prison greys. A CANARY, perched on his
text: shoulder, SINGS HAPPILY as he stands in front of a grimy,
text: cracked mirror, plastering back his hair, BUFFING HIS NAILS
text: with quick, birdlike strokes.
text: MR. BONIFACE is beak-nosed, epicene, and so fat that it seems
dialog: his skin should burst; the adjective that comes to mind is
text: "obscene." Despite his eccentric appearance, he comports
text: himself with overblown, theatrical dignity. Fastidious and
text: preening, he does not suffer insults lightly.
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK FURTHER -- through another set of bars --
text: and we realize that MR. BONIFACE is himself caged. A PRISON
text: GUARD arrives to slide back his cell door...
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Up and at 'em, Pengy. -- Pengy?
text: MR. BONIFACE pointedly ignores the GUARD, refusing to
dialog: acknowledge the odious (if wholly appropriate) nickname.
speaker_heading: GUARD (cont.)
dialog: Boniface...
text: MR. BONIFACE finally turns. With an expression of extreme
text: distaste, he affixes a MONOCLE over one eye, returns the
text: canary to its cage and allows himself to be ushered out.
scene_heading: INT. WARDEN'S OFFICE - DAY
text: MR. BONIFACE and his ATTORNEY sit at a long table across from
text: the WARDEN and the members of the PAROLE BOARD.
speaker_heading: PAROLE OFFICER
dialog: You want to return the money you stole.
speaker_heading: BONIFACE
dialog: Intact. The map will show you where it's
dialog: buried.
text: The PAROLE OFFICER stares skeptically at a hand-scrawled MAP.
speaker_heading: PAROLE OFFICER
dialog: All of it. Forty-two million dollars.
text: MR. BONIFACE stares down humbly at the table -- as if he finds
dialog: the mere mention of his transgression too embarrassing to
dialog: bear.
speaker_heading: PAROLE OFFICER II
dialog: Why this sudden change of heart?
speaker_heading: MR. BONIFACE
dialog: Gentlemen, I want my debt to be repaid in
dialog: full. I want to be a part of civilized
dialog: society!
dialog: <i>(oozing sincerity)</i>
dialog: Prison life is not for me. The guilt, the
dialog: fear, the constant shame...one meets a
text: disturbingly low class of people.
speaker_heading: PAROLE OFFICER II
dialog: Sure, but -- forty-two million dollars??
text: MR. BONIFACE nods plaintively. It's quite a perfomlance. He
text: dabs at his face with a handkerchief; it's hot in here, and
dialog: he's the delicate type...
speaker_heading: WARDEN
dialog: His record's clean. Thirteen years
dialog: without an incident.
speaker_heading: ATTORNEY
dialog: I'd like to point out, my client's put his
dialog: time to good use. A student of
dialog: ornithology...articles published in
dialog: several respected journals...
text: The PAROLE OFFICER thumbs through a stack of magazines: Bird
text: World, Ornithological Review, Beaks And Feathers, Nest Egg.
speaker_heading: MR. BONIFACE
dialog: Birds, yes. My only source of solace.
speaker_heading: PAROLE OFFICER
dialog: In light of this rather extraordinary
dialog: gesture, I see no reason not to endorse
dialog: your application for parole.
speaker_heading: BONIFACE
dialog: Thank you, sir. You won't regret it.
text: MR. BONIFACE shakes hands with the members of the PAROLE
text: BOARD. As the GUARDS escort him out, a BLACK MYNAH BIRD
text: SQUAWKS LOUDLY from its cage in the corner of the office:
speaker_heading: MYNAH
text: CRIME DOES NOT PAY. AAWWK!! CRIME DOES
dialog: NOT PAY.
text: CHUCKLES all around. On his way out the ATTORNEY gestures
text: toward the mynah -- and BEAMS at the parole board:
speaker_heading: ATTORNEY
dialog: Personally trained by my client.
scene_heading: INT. PRISON CELL - DAY
text: Free time -- the cell doors are open and the convicts are
text: milling around in the common area. T-BONE, 220 lbs. of dumb,
text: hulking beef, saunters up to his cell and finds his bunkmate,
text: MR. BONIFACE, staring at a stack of EMPTY CAGES. BONIFACE
text: whirls on him suddenly, his face beet-red, APOPLECTIC WITH
speaker_heading: RAGE:
speaker_heading: MR. BONIFACE
dialog: -- Where are my birds?!?
speaker_heading: T-BONE
dialog: Shit, Pengy. I let 'em go.
speaker_heading: MR. BONIFACE
dialog: Hermione. My canary. It's the dead of
dialog: winter!
text: T-BONE flops casually on his bunk, obviously enjoying MR.
text: BONIFACE's profound distress.
speaker_heading: T-BONE
dialog: They were all cooped up. With you leaving
dialog: and all -- seemed like the humane thing to
dialog: do.
text: BONIFACE'S GAZE FALLS on a corner of the cell. He spots a
text: scattering of YELLOW FEATHERS -- a patch of FRESH BLOOD. With
text: a supreme effort of restraint, he turns and forces a smile...
speaker_heading: MR. BONIFACE
dialog: I see. -- You might as well have this. I
dialog: won't be needing it...
text: He tosses a SONY WALKMAN to T-BONE, who flicks it on. The dim
text: strains of CLASSICAL MUSIC are audible through the
dialog: earphones...
speaker_heading: T-BONE
dialog: Well, thanks, Pengy. No hard feelings.
dialog: <i>(chuckling to himself)</i>
dialog: Y'know, I'm gonna miss that pudgy little
dialog: ass of yours.
text: T-BONE tunes the Walkman to a rock station, slips the headset
text: on, grins from his bunk. TWO GUARDS arrive. As they escort
text: him out, MR. BONIFACE mutters:
speaker_heading: MR. BONIFACE
dialog: You won't miss it long.
scene_heading: EXT. PRISON - MAIN ENTRANCE - DAY
text: It's fifteen degrees outside as MR. BONIFACE -- aka THE
text: PENGUIN -- waddles forth from the prison gates, regally
text: attired in cutaway and pin-stripes. He pauses to inhale a
text: deep lungful of the icy air; then, with a smile of
text: exhilaration, he removes his coat and STRETCHES -- spreading
text: his wings, REVELING in the cold.
text: A STRETCH LIMO pulls up. Two identically gaunt and vulture-
text: like DANDIES, formally dressed, with bowler hats and
text: umbrellas, step out to meet him. These two gentlemen -- FRICK
text: and FRACK -- serve as the Penguin's general factoti and
dialog: "business managers."
speaker_heading: FRICK
dialog: Welcome back, Mr. Boniface.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Mr. Frick. Mr. Frack. Our years of
text: planning are about to pay off.
scene_heading: INT. LIMO - MOVING - DAY
text: Now that he's loose, the PENGUIN's rapacious side is beginning
text: to show. His eyes twinkle with greed as he contemplates his
dialog: own ingenuity.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: I take it they found the money all right?
speaker_heading: FRACK
dialog: We buried it exactly as you specified.
dialog: $42,271,009...
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: How much have we got left?
text: FRICK reaches into his coat for a BALANCE SHEET.
speaker_heading: FRICK
dialog: Let's see -- an initial capitalization of
dialog: 42 million and change, compounded over
dialog: thirteen years, at an annual return of
dialog: just under sixteen percent --
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Fine, fine. How much?
speaker_heading: FRICK
dialog: Seventy-nine million. -- Excluding the
dialog: sum we buried.
text: THE PENGUIN lets out a dry, heaving CHORTLE, midway between a
text: normal laugh and a DUCK'S QUACK. He checks his watch and
text: reaches into his pocket for a small ELECTRONIC DEVICE.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Speaking of burials...
scene_heading: EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY
text: T-BONE on work detail. He's got the Walkman on and he's
text: shoveling snow to the beat. He winces, and removes the
dialog: headphones...
text: The MUSIC he was listening to has been replaced by an eerie,
text: high-pitched WHINE. He's twisting the knob, trying to find
text: the station he was tuned to, when a PIGEON dives down STRAIGHT
text: AT HIS HEAD.
speaker_heading: T-BONE
dialog: HEY -- !
text: He drops the shovel as the bird STRIKES, glancing off his
text: head. Before he can react, THREE MORE PIGEONS have swooped
text: down at him, PECKING at his head and shoulders in a frenzy.
text: He lets out a HOWL and staggers through the prison yard in a
text: frenzy. DOZENS of PIGEONS are pouring over the prison walls,
text: SHRIEKING HIDEOUSLY, descending on him. He falls to the
text: ground screaming for help, but the other prisoners run like
text: rabbits, terrified...
text: By the time the GUARDS come racing across the courtyard,
text: T-BONE's no longer even visible. There's just a swarming,
text: man-shaped mass of PIGEONS, pecking away, flapping their wings
text: insanely. Covering their faces as they move in, the GUARDS
text: blow their whistles -- BEAT AT the pigeons with billy clubs.
text: All at once, the PIGEONS take off <i>en masse</i> -- leaving T-BONE's
text: mutilated corpse sprawled in the yard. A GUARD notices the
text: Walkman, picks up the earphones to listen, and hears nothing
text: but ROCK MUSIC -- "Surfin' Bird" by the Trashmen. Bird bird
dialog: bird, bird is the word...
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - ON PENGUIN'S LIMO - MOVING
text: An AERIAL VIEW of the LIMO as it cruises down the deserted
text: road leading away from the prison. It disappears from view --
text: and all at once the frame is filled with PIGEONS, great
text: squalling FLOCKS of them, dutifully following their master as
text: he makes his way back to Gotham City.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT
text: ALFRED opens the front door and finds a bundled-up VICKI out
text: on the portico, red-cheeked, flushed, and happy. She pulls
text: him forward, gives him a quick peck on the cheek.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Guess what, Alfred. I think I found a
dialog: present for Bruce.
text: She's got a long, skinny GIFT BOX propped up against the
text: exterior wall. At first it doesn't want to fit through the
text: door -- it must be eight feet long -- but with ALFRED's help
text: she gets it inside. The faithful butler stares curiously at
dialog: this odd-shaped gift...
speaker_heading: VICKI (cont.)
dialog: Skis. -- Don't let on, okay?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: He won't hear a word of it from me.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: He's such a nightmare to shop for. --
dialog: What do you get him year after year,
dialog: Alfred?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: <i>(conspiratorially)</i>
dialog: I find you can't go wrong with
dialog: surveillance equipment. Let me put this
dialog: under the tree...
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Not so fast.
text: She reaches into the pocket of her coat and pulls out another
text: small gift. ALFRED stares at the tag -- "TO ALFRED, LOVE
text: VICKI" -- and tries to suppress a HUGE GRIN.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Why, Miss Vale -- !
scene_heading: VOICE FROM BEHIND
dialog: What's all this?
text: ALFRED and VICKI turn. It's BRUCE, dressed for dinner,
text: marching down the long stairway in the entry hall. VICKI
text: waves frantically.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Don't look. It's your present.
text: VICKI rushes over to embrace him. He gapes at the long skinny
dialog: box --
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What'd you get me? Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?
text: VICKI frowns and gives him a kiss. She nestles up against
text: him. WHISPERS in his ear:
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I'm going to give you the happiest
dialog: Christmas you've ever had.
text: Still in the clinch, BRUCE shoots a look at ALFRED. Taking
text: the hint, ALFRED clears his throat and bends to pick up one
text: end of the ski box. He backs out of the entry hall, dragging
text: the box before him...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM PARK - NIGHT
text: FIRES burn in garbage cans. TENTS and LEAN-TOS dot the snowy
text: landscape. Men, women, and children wander aimlessly,
text: huddling against the cold.
text: An army of the HOMELESS has set up camp in Gotham Park. On
text: the nearby periphery, PICKETERS -- half concerned citizens,
text: half down-and-outers -- are marching the sidewalks, keeping a
text: candlelight VIGIL. Hand-lettered placards read: "SAVE THE
text: PARK." "PARKS ARE FOR PEOPLE." "THIS PARK IS OUR HOME."
text: The source of the protest? A towering SIGN posted in a corner
text: of the park, announcing the imminent consuuction of a new
text: luxury highrise -- the GOTHAM PARK TOWERS -- a project of Shaw
dialog: Construction, Inc.
text: A LAMBORGHINI sits at a traffic light nearby...
scene_heading: INT. LAMBORGHINI - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Homeless.
dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: I was just down here Tuesday. Seems like
dialog: there's more every day.
text: BRUCE starts to say something, but can't think of anything to
dialog: say.
speaker_heading: VICKI (cont.)
dialog: Christmas time. And they say there's over
text: a thousand people living in the park
dialog: already.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: -- Yeah.
text: The light changes. BRUCE throws the car into gear and -- at
text: the next intersection -- turns the car right, into the park.
scene_heading: EXT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT
text: Despite the name, it's a tony little bistro catering to
text: Gotham's elite. A PANHANDLER, underdressed for the cold, has
text: been hustling the customers as they come out; a couple of
text: PARKING ATTENDANTS are trying to drag him discreetly away as
text: BRUCE'S CAR pulls up.
text: A VALET opens the car for BRUCE and VICKI, who look on in
text: concern as the PANHANDLER gets the bum's rush. The liveried
text: DOORMAN shrugs apolagetically -- sorry for the inconvenience
text: -- as they enter.
scene_heading: INT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT
text: Post-dinner. VICKI's got a sheaf of PHOTOS spread out on the
text: table in front of BRUCE -- shots of Gotham's HOMELESS, being
text: forcibly evicted from slum dwellings, erecting their
text: SHANTYTOWNS in Gotham Park.
speaker_heading: VICKI
text: They're already razing the tenements and
dialog: SRO's downtown. These people don't have
dialog: anyplace else to go.
dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: If the city starts selling off the park...
text: BRUCE takes a good long look at his opulent surroundings.
text: HUGE WINDOWS open on a serene and picturesque view of the
text: park; CAMPFIRES flicker in the distance...
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: -- Yeah. I guess I'll pass on dessert.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: <i>(taking his hand)</i>
dialog: Bruce, you do a lot more than most people
dialog: even dream of.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Sure. Comes off the top of my taxes --
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: That's not what I meant.
text: They exchange a long silent look. Of course she's referring
text: to Batman. Still, the argument doesn't hold much water with
speaker_heading: BRUCE.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: -- What I "do" doesn't come close to the
dialog: root of the problem, Vicki.

dialog: I'm just a Band-Aid.
scene_heading: VOICE FROM BEHIND
dialog: Bruce! It's been ages!
text: VICKI turns -- and rapidly closes her photo folder.
text: Millionaire construction magnate RANDALL SHAW is in the
text: restaurant table-hopping, and he's just glommed onto BRUCE.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Randall. You remember Vicki. -- How's
dialog: the construction business?
speaker_heading: SHAW
dialog: The park tower? All systems go. If we

text: Not too late to get in on the deal.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I'll think about it.
speaker_heading: SHAW
dialog: Say, Walter Barrett's due back from
dialog: Europe. We should all get together at the
dialog: club.
dialog: <i>(clapping him on the shoulder)</i>
dialog: Nice to see you again, Miss Veal.
text: "Miss Veal" maintains a big phony smile as SHAW moves off to
text: the next table. She murmurs to BRUCE through clenched teeth:
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: What a pig.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I've known him since he was seven years
dialog: old. He was a pig then too.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Now he wants to gobble up the park...
dialog: <i>(shivering)</i>
dialog: Bruce -- isn't there something you can do
dialog: about people like that?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What, tie him up with a bat-rope?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: No, you idiot. I meant you. Bruce.
text: BRUCE nods -- oh, yeah. Subtle distinction.
scene_heading: INT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT
text: BRUCE and VICKI emerge from the restaurant. He hands his
text: parking stub to a VALET. A crowd's beginning to form in the
dialog: lot outside...
text: The red-and-blue bubble of a POLICE CAR is flashing a short
text: distance off, near the entrance to the park. TWO RED BERETS,
text: in full Order-of-the-Bat regalia, look on as a recently-mugged
text: WOMAN JOGGER gives her statement to the investigating COPS.
text: BRUCE and VICKI, intrigued by the Batman-wannabes, move a
text: little closer -- within eavesdropping range:
speaker_heading: RED BERET I
dialog: We were on patrol. Saw the whole thing.
speaker_heading: JOGGER
dialog: I was attacked. Three men in ski masks --
speaker_heading: COP I
scene_heading: <i>(indicating the RED BERETS)</i>
dialog: And these two broke it up?
speaker_heading: JOGGER
dialog: These two?? They ran like rabbits. I
dialog: never saw anybody take off so --
speaker_heading: RED BERET II
dialog: Hey! Somebody had to go for the cops.
speaker_heading: COP II
dialog: You. SHUT UP, all right??
speaker_heading: <i>(to the JOGGER)</i>
dialog: Lady, who was it that bailed you out??
speaker_heading: JOGGER
dialog: A kid. Thirteen or fourteen tops. He
text: just came out of nowhere and -- tore into
dialog: 'em.
dialog: <i>(shaking her head)</i>
text: It was so quick I didn't even see his
dialog: face.
text: Nearby, VICKI shoots a highly quizzical look at BRUCE, who
text: responds with a mystified shrug. Her professional curiosity
text: piqued, she wanders over to introduce herself to the JOGGER.
text: An exasperated COP leads the RED BERETS away from the crime
dialog: site:
speaker_heading: RED BERET I
dialog: Dumb shit. Shouldn'ta been jogging in the

dialog: <i>(sullenly)</i>

scene_heading: INT. WHARF RAT - NIGHT

text: that is, except for a strapping young bruiser named RICKY, who
text: gets up and makes his way to a pay phone in the corner.
text: Moments later, the owner of the high heels enters; she opens
text: her black fur coat and unwraps her muffler, revealing exotic,
text: vaguely Eurasian features. She's dark and elegant, fine-
dialog: boned, regal of bearing -- and her name, though we don't know
text: it yet, is SELINA KYLE.
dialog: She's not the kind of girl who typically frequents the Wharf
text: Rat, and so her entrance creates quite a stir. A LONGSHOREMAN
text: at the nearby pool table misses his shot and digs a rut in the
text: felt. Two blowsy WHORES size her up territorially as she
text: finds an open stool at the bar and settles in with serene
text: indifference.
text: The regulars, of course, are all but licking their chops. The
text: only guy in the joint who hasn't noticed her yet is RICKY,
dialog: who's still on the phone:
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Yo. Ricky here. What's the haps?
text: In mid-conversation he notices SELINA. She smiles invitingly
text: -- right at him. Mildly startled, he smiles back.
speaker_heading: RICKY (cont.)
dialog: Midnight. No sweat. See you then.
text: He hangs up eagerly. Then, with a deep breath, he hitches up
text: his pants and swaggers over to SELINA's end of the bar.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Well. "Ricky," is it?
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: How'd you know that?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I heard you on the phone. Talking to your
dialog: girlfriend.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Girlfriend? No, no. That was business.
text: SELINA makes a big show of peeling off her gloves.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: If you've got time for a little pleasure
dialog: ...maybe you'd like to buy me a drink.
text: She clasps his hand. His EYES BUG OUT. Three enormous rings,
dialog: a diamond bracelet -- there must be several thousand in rocks
text: on her left hand alone. RICKY gapes at the sparklers,
text: bedazzled.
speaker_heading: RICKY
text: Jeez -- they look almost real.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Why wouldn't they be?
dialog: RICKY is not the smoothest guy around, and his line of thought
text: is all too evident. He swallows hard and tries not to stare.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: You'd have to be crazy. Nobody'd wear the
dialog: real thing to a dive like this.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Oh, they're real, all right. So are
dialog: these.
text: She waves her FINGERNAILS -- long, polished, and talon-sharp
text: -- in front of his eyes. With lightning speed, before he can
text: react, she pins his wrist to the bar -- and with one quick
text: stroke carves a THIN BLOODY STRIPE in the back of his hand.
text: SELINA's eyes flash as he gasps in shock. He tries to jerk
text: his hand away, but he can't break her grip. Then -- her
text: dominance firmly established -- she releases his hand with a
text: coy, Cheshire-cat smile.
speaker_heading: SELINA (cont.)
dialog: Weren't we going to have a drink?
text: He blinks, forces a chuckle, smiles unsteadily. She takes his
text: wounded hand, lifts it slowly to her mouth, and LAPS GENTLY at
text: the blood. RICKY is hypnotized.
text: She's got an odd way of flirting, but RICKY finds it somehow
text: -- intriguing. He dabs at his hand with a napkin and signals
text: to the BARTENDER.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WATERFRONT - PIER 31 - NIGHT
text: Just after midnight; the snow's still failing, the waters are
text: icy, and the wharfs are deserted -- almost. A small STEAMBOAT
text: is docked at Pier 31, and the deck is lined with THUGS --
text: mean, ugly, and heavily armed.
text: A similar contingent of gun-toting GOONS is waiting to greet
text: them on the dock below. The boys on the dock hoist ASSAULT
text: RIFLES as the BOAT THUGS extend a gangplank. Something major
dialog: is about to happen...
text: The CHIEF DOCK GOON gestures to his LIEUTENANT, who grabs a
text: black MEDICAL BAG. Hands raised, the two of them start up the
dialog: gangplank.
text: Throughout all this, the DOCK GOONS keep their guns trained on
text: the BOAT THUGS, covering their buddies. One of them turns to
dialog: a colleague:
speaker_heading: DOCK GOON I
dialog: Where's that goddam Ricky?
speaker_heading: DOCK GOON II
dialog: Probably out gettin' laid. And here we
dialog: are freezin' our balls off...
scene_heading: EXT. STEAMBOAT - ON DECK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: The LIEUTENANT unloads chemical testing gear from his doctor's
text: bag. The lead BOAT THUG gestures to a stack of SHIPPING
text: CRATES which rest atop a large NET spread out across the deck.
speaker_heading: BOAT THUG I
dialog: You pick.
text: The CHIEF GOON selects a crate at random. Two BOAT THUGS tip
text: it on its side and, using a crowbar, pry off a FALSE BOTTOM --
text: revealing a dozen packets of WHITE POWDER.
scene_heading: POV SHOT - HIGH ANGLE - THAT MOMENT
text: We're now watching the scene from a vantage point atop a
text: ramshackle boathouse at water's edge. Down on the deck of the
text: steamboat, the LIEUTENANT goes to work testing the
dialog: merchandise.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT
dialog: It's pure.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE - THAT MOMENT
text: A BLACK SILHOUETTE is peering down from the boathouse roof.
text: The mysterious watcher ducks quickly out of sight; the only
text: details that register are a pair of ominously familiar POINTY
dialog: EARS...
speaker_heading: CHIEF GOON (O.S.)
dialog: Let's do it.
text: He gestures to his boys on the dock. A CRANE-AND-WINCH
text: assembly rotates into place over the deck -- and the BOAT
text: THUGS gather up the corners of the netting and attach them to
text: the big hook.
speaker_heading: BOAT THUG I
dialog: Hold it. Let's see the money.
text: Down on the wharf, a DOCK GOON kneels beside a metal suitcase
text: and opens it. Lots of long green inside. The BOAT THUG
text: signals thumbs up, and the CRATES rise into the air as the
text: goon with the suitcase starts up the gangplank.
scene_heading: LOW ANGLE - ON GANGPLANK - THAT MOMENT
text: The goon with the suitcase marches up. Beyond him, in the
text: distance, a LITHE BLACK SHADOW vaults off the boathouse roof
text: and makes a silent, graceful landing on the long shaft of the
speaker_heading: CRANE.
scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE - THAT MOMENT
text: The moment of maximum tension: grim faces all around, everyone
text: holding a gun on someone else as the suitcase arrives on deck
text: and crane swings over the pier.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON CRANE - THAT MOMENT
text: Razor-sharp, CHROME-STEEL TALONS slash suddenly through the
dialog: air.
scene_heading: ON DOCK - LOW ANGLE - THAT MOMENT
text: The netting GIVES WAY, and TWO DOZEN SHIPPING CRATES rain down
text: onto the pier, CRUSHING two DOCK GOONS underneath. The crates
text: explode into splinters, littering the dock with drugs and
text: random ART OBJECTS as the other DOCK GOONS scatter in panic.
scene_heading: ON STEAMBOAT - THAT MOMENT
text: Nobody knows quite what's going on. Panicking, the GOON with
text: the suitcase full of money turns tail and dives for the
text: gangplank. BOAT THUG I sees him and squeezes off a quick
text: shot. Winged, the GOON topples off the gangplank and hits the
dialog: drink, suitcase and all.
text: Pandemonium. All at once, everyone's OPENING FIRE. Thinking
text: he's been double-crossed, BOAT THUG I turns on the CHIEF GOON
text: and SHOOTS HIM TWICE at point-blank range.
speaker_heading: BOAT THUG I
dialog: YOU SON OF A BITCH!
scene_heading: <i>(to another BOAT THUG)</i>
dialog: Go after it. Get the money. GO!!
text: He raises his gun, and the second BOAT THUG dutifully obeys --
text: diving off the deck into a hail of gunfire. Everyone's
text: ducking for cover. BOAT THUG I barks orders at the
dialog: pilothouse:
speaker_heading: BOAT THUG I
dialog: Soltar las amarras! -- CAST OFF!!
scene_heading: ANOTHER BOAT THUG
speaker_heading: LOOK!
text: BOAT THUG I whirls, just in time to see a SHADOWY FIGURE
text: landing cat-like on the deck mere yards away. Clad in inky
text: black leather from head to toe, the intruder's face is
text: concealed by what appears to be a BONDAGE MASK. Studded, with
text: openings for the eyes and mouth, it spans one incongruous
text: touch: a pair of POINTED CAT EARS.
text: She bares her teeth and HISSES.
dialog: It's a woman.
text: BOAT THUG I is momentarily mesmerized. In the time it takes
text: him to lift his gun, she's produced a CAT-O'-NINE-TAILS. She
text: SNAPS it at him: REELS HIM IN; and with one lethal stroke,
text: RAKES her steel talons across his face and throat. He slumps
text: to the deck, lifeless.
text: The other BOAT THUG rushes her; she catches him under the jaw
text: with a sudden upthrust, LIFTS HIM INTO THE AIR, and sends him
text: toppling into the water.
text: The gangplank falls aside as the steamboat pulls away from the
text: pier. She hoists an abandoned ASSAULT RIFLE, SCATTERS the
text: DOCK GOONS with a round of automatic fire, and VAULTS off the
text: boat -- landing in a graceful crouch on the edge of the pier.
text: Most of the DOCK GOONS have taken flight, but a few unlucky
text: specimens remain behind. She somersaults forward; takes one
text: goon off his feet with a crack of the whip; knocks another off
text: the dock with a twirling high-kick to the jaw; sends two more
text: reeling with swift talon-slashes. The whole frenzied mop-up
text: action takes just under ten seconds. Alone at last, she
text: stands back to survey the scene.
text: Counting the stiff's on the boat -- which is now receding in
text: the harbor -- there must be well over a dozen dead. The snow
text: is speckled with red. A half-dozen bodies lie sprawled in
text: their own blood; one of them, the lone survivor, is face-down
text: and softly MOANING.
text: Retracting her steel claws, the MASKED WOMAN crouches amid the
text: wreckage of the smashed shipping crates. BINDLES OF WHITE
text: POWDER -- millions of dollars' worth -- are scattered all
text: about the pier, but she couldn't seem less interested.
text: Instead, she's checking the MANIFEST NUMBERS stamped on the
text: sides of the crates.
text: She finds crate #18396-BB and rummages among its contents
text: until she comes up with a carefully-wrapped parcel. She opens
text: it carefully and holds it up for inspection. The statuette of
text: a RAVEN -- carved from solid onyx -- glistens in the
dialog: moonlight.
text: The WOMAN pauses long enough to slip a small CARD in the
text: MOANING PUNK's back pocket. Then, cradling the raven under
text: one arm, she dashes off on silent cat feet.
text: A LANTERN approaches. It's an OLD SALT -- some kind of
text: hapless night watchman -- and his face goes bone-white at the
text: sight of the carnage on the docks. He kneels beside the
text: moaning punk, turns the body over, and GASPS -- because the
text: PUNK'S FACE has been CLAWED TO SHREDS.
speaker_heading: PUNK
dialog: Murcielago. MURCIELAGO!!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - NIGHT
text: The unique chamber in which we find ourselves is alive with
text: the flutter and song of COLD-WEATHER BIRDS -- dozens of them,
text: all chirping, flitting about in the rafters, alighting on
text: special perches mounted in the walls.
text: At the center of this penthouse room is a vast sunken POOL.
text: ARCTIC TERNS loll on the surrounding rocks as a LACKEY with a
text: wheelbarrow empties cracked ice into the already-frigid water.
text: Carefully landscaped, it looks like the penguin exhibit at the
dialog: Gotham Zoological Gardens.
text: A MASSIVE, INDISTINCT SHAPE glides beneath the surface. It's
text: not a whale; it's too pink. It is, instead, the PENGUIN --
text: and as he breaks the surface, sputtering, he sees FRICK
text: standing in the open doorway.
speaker_heading: FRICK
dialog: Mr. Boniface? Your...visitor has arrived.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Thank you, Mr. Frick. Show her in.
text: The PENGUIN moves to the edge of the sunken pool. Two of his
text: LACKEYS swivel a CROSSBAR, which hangs from the ceiling by a
text: long chain, into place over his head. He grasps it with both
text: hands -- and the crossbar RISES, hoisting his formidable bulk
text: out of the water.
scene_heading: INT. HIGH-RISE - CORRIDOR - THAT MOMENT
text: FRICK leads the VISITOR down a long corridor lined on either
text: side with BIRD CAGES -- exotic songbirds with brilliantly-hued
text: plumage. CAMERA TRACKS ALONG behind her, and although we
text: can't see her face, there must be something distinctively
text: feline about her -- because the BIRDS are shrieking and
text: fluttering in their cages, RECOILING INSTINCTIVELY as she
text: strolls past.
text: FRICK opens a door and ushers her into...
scene_heading: INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
text: Our visitor -- SELINA KYLE -- enters the penguin-pool room.
text: Her teeth begin to chatter. The big bay windows have been
text: thrown open, and SNOW is blowing in from outside. It's
dialog: freezing in here.
text: She sees the PENGUIN -- wearing a thin dressing gown and an
text: APRON outfitted with SEED POUCHES -- scattering birdseed on
text: the window ledge for the pigeons, totally oblivious to the
text: cold. He turns, throws his arms wide in greeting, kisses the
text: back of SELINA's hand.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Ah, Miss Kyle! At last we meet.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: At last we meet. -- Pigeons?
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Yes, they're common birds -- dirty,
dialog: stupid, unattractive -- but they're very
dialog: obedient, and they do crap on people's
dialog: heads. May I?
text: She extends a SHOPPING BAG. The PENGUIN removes a parcel and
text: unwraps it, revealing the RAVEN STATUETTE. He sets it on a
text: nearby desk, fondles it reverently...and BEAMS at SELINA.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN (cont.)
dialog: I see your reputation was not exaggerated.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I've located the others. All but one.
dialog: <i>(shivering)</i>
dialog: I'm surprised you don't catch
dialog: pneumonia -- !
text: With an apologetic smile, the PENGUIN pulls the windows shut.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: My normal body temperature is ninety-two
dialog: degrees. Germs find me inhospitable.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I see why they call you the Penguin.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: They may call me that...but rarely more
dialog: than once. Champagne?
text: She nods. He pours two glasses, hands one to SELINA, raises a
dialog: toast.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN (cont.)
dialog: My dear. Here's to the second biggest
dialog: crime in the history of Gotham City.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. POLICE OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: COMMISSIONER GORDON and another cop, LT. EDDIE BULLOCK, are in
text: darkened antechamber adjacent to an interrogation room.
speaker_heading: BULLOCK
dialog: It wasn't about the drugs. Whoever it was
text: left thirty kilos sitting on the docks.
text: They're watching, through a two-way glass panel, as a
text: terrified man with a heavily-bandaged face tells his story.
text: It's the lone survivor of the dock massacre, JULIO, and his
text: voice is audible over a concealed intercom:
speaker_heading: JULIO (filter)
dialog: Un silueta negra -- con colmillos, y
dialog: garras -- el demonio. El murcielago.
speaker_heading: MURCIELAGO!
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: What's that he keeps saying?
speaker_heading: BULLOCK
dialog: "Murcielago." -- Bat.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Nonsense. That dock looked like a
dialog: slaughter-house. Batman's never committed
dialog: murder.
speaker_heading: BULLOCK
dialog: We did find this in his back pocket.
text: BULLOCK hands GORDON a CARD. It reads: "THOSE WHO FEED ON THE
text: SOUL OF GOTHAM WILL SUFFER MY WRATH" -- and in lieu of a
text: signature, there's a little black BAT-EMBLEM in the bottom
dialog: corner.
text: While GORDON's staring at it, a POLICEMAN pokes his head in:
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: Commissioner? We've got Barrett.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT
text: A cubicle down the hall. The splenetic WALTER BARRETT,
text: millionaire industrialist, is fidgeting in his chair as GORDON
text: enters.
speaker_heading: BARRETT
dialog: Fine welcome. These storm troopers of
dialog: yours dragged me away from my coming-home
dialog: party!
dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: I'd like to know the meaning of this --
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: I'd like to know how thirty kilos of pure
dialog: cocaine wound up concealed in your
dialog: personal effects.
speaker_heading: BARRETT
dialog: Gordon -- I come from one of the oldest
dialog: and most influential familles in Gotham.
dialog: If you plan to accuse me of smuggling
dialog: drugs, be my guest.
dialog: <i>(long, menacing pause)</i>
dialog: I'll have your badge before you leave this
dialog: room.
text: GORDON weighs the threat. He nods to the COPS in
dialog: attendance...
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Book the son of a bitch.
text: GORDON storms out. BARRETT jumps out of his chair, but the
text: COPS restrain him. Outraged, he bats their hands away...
speaker_heading: BARRETT
dialog: I believe I'm still entitled to a phone
dialog: call.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN GOTHAM - DAY
text: VICKI with her camera, squeezing off snaps. She's standing
text: behind a SAWHORSE, part of a crowd of onlookers at a downtown
text: DEMOLITION SITE. SURVEYORS and HARDHATS bustle about in a
text: VACANT LOT, a full city block in size, fenced off and strewn
text: with rubble. The only structure still standing is a lone,
text: decrepit TENEMENT BUILDING; a WRECKING BALL is poised above
text: it, ready to strike.
text: A SIGN at one corner of the lot announces a forty-story OFFICE
text: COMPLEX soon to be erected on this site by SHAW CONSTRUCTION,
text: INC. Down below is RANDALL SHAW HIMSELF, in necktie and
text: hardhat, speaking into a WALKIE-TALKIE:
speaker_heading: SHAW
dialog: Come on! Let's move it! We're an hour
dialog: behind as it is!!
text: A few moments later, a CLUSTER OF PEOPLE emerge from the
text: tenement building -- a mixed team of COPS and CONSTRUCTION
text: GOONS who are forcibly removing a DESTITUTE FAMILY from the
text: condenmed building. VICKI watches angrily...
scene_heading: HER POV - TELEPHOTO LENS
text: A quick series of shots: the SQUATTERS wailing and struggling,
text: clinging to the doorways, unwilling to leave. Their few
text: belongings are packed in a couple of CARDBOARD BOXES, which
text: the cops heave rudely out onto the street. Finally, the
text: handcuffs and nightsticks come out...
scene_heading: ANGLE ON SHAW - THAT MOMENT - DAY
text: A SURVEYOR grabs SHAW by the arm and points out the woman
text: taking photos in the crowd. SHAW recognizes her instantly.
text: His face turns into a mask of outrage -- as if he's been
dialog: personally betrayed.
speaker_heading: SHAW
dialog: Jesus Christ, that's Bruce Wayne's bimbo!
text: He makes eye contact with her. VICKI stares back defiantly.
text: He's about to stroll over and tell her off when a HARDHAT
dialog: signals to him:
speaker_heading: HARDHAT
dialog: Phone call, Mr. Shaw. Guy said it's
dialog: urgent.
speaker_heading: SHAW
scene_heading: <i>(to tbe SURVEYOR)</i>
dialog: Hold the ball. I wanna hear it crash.
text: He climbs into the cab of a nearby TRUCK, where he picks up a
scene_heading: CELLULAR PHONE.
scene_heading: INTERCUT - BARRETT AND SHAW
text: BARRETT's still in custody at the police station -- using his
text: one phone call to contact the construction magnate.
speaker_heading: BARRETT
dialog: It's me, Randall -- Walter Barrett. I
dialog: want you to call my attorney. That was my
dialog: shipment they busted up last night.
speaker_heading: SHAW
dialog: Jesus, Walter, I --
dialog: <i>(suddenly puzzled)</i>
dialog: Why are you calling me??
speaker_heading: BARRETT
dialog: It's worse than that. Somebody took my
text: raven.
text: SHAW stares at the phone in horrified disbelief.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON VICKI - THAT MOMENT
text: SHE WATCHES as SHAW climbs out of the truck -- numb, in a
text: daze. He signals to the WRECKING BALL OPERATOR; a WHISTLE
text: blows, and the great iron ball knocks a MAMMOTH HOLE in the
text: facade of the tenement.
text: SHAW doesn't even stick around to watch it. He scurries off
text: to his car at the end of the block. VICKI, highly intrigued,
dialog: gets it all on film...
scene_heading: INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY
text: VICKI's in a huddle with the Managing Editor, SCHULTZ, showing
text: him her PHOTOS -- SHAW orchestrating the eviction of the
scene_heading: SQUATTER FAMILY.
speaker_heading: SCHULTZ
dialog: Great stuff, but we're looking at a
dialog: shitfight with our beloved publisher. He
dialog: and Shaw...
dialog: <i>(crossing his fingers)</i>
dialog: Old money sticks together.
text: VICKI points to a photo of SHAW racing from the truck to his
dialog: car.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I'd sure like to know what shook him up
text: so. He was out of there like a scared
dialog: rabbit...
text: Just then, a reporter -- WILK -- rushes up excitedly to
text: SCHULTZ's desk.
speaker_heading: WILK
dialog: Got a blind tip from downtown. You know
dialog: that massacre on the docks? Batman.
text: VICKI reacts in astonishment. SCHULTZ's jaw drops -- this is
dialog: hot.
speaker_heading: EDITOR
dialog: Whoa! Is this on the level?
speaker_heading: WILK
dialog: Cops even got a note. "Those who feed on
dialog: the soul of Gotham will suffer my wrath!"
dialog: <i>(grinning; to VICKI)</i>
dialog: Sounds like your pal's cranked it up a
dialog: notch.
text: VICKI starts to protest, but thinks better of it.
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY HALL - EVENING

scene_heading: BATMAN IMPLICATED IN DOCK MASSACRE

speaker_heading: VICKI

speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I'm afraid so, Miss Vale. Master Bruce is

scene_heading: INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING
text: On their way to the Batcave, ALFRED and VICKI pass through the
text: library. They pause in front of the television -- which is
text: tuned to a PANEL SHOW, with various experts discussing the hot
dialog: issue of the day.
scene_heading: ENVIRONMENTALIST (on TV)
dialog: Walter Barrett's no saint. His factories
text: have been dumping poison into the air and
dialog: water for years. If he is mixed up with
dialog: drugs...
speaker_heading: PUNDIT (on TV)
dialog: That's not the issue. The issue is, do we
dialog: entrust our public safety to some...masked
dialog: vigilante. Does Batman have a license to
dialog: kill?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: <i>(shaking his head)</i>
dialog: Ah, the public. Dishearteningly fickle.
text: VICKI follows ALFRED out. We HOLD on the TV as the CAMERA
text: PANS OVER to the third guest on the panel, loudly demanding
text: air time. He's wearing a RED BERET and a BATMAN SWEATSHIRT:
scene_heading: MIKE SEKOWSKY (on TV)
dialog: Yo, here's the tip, man. Drug dealers are
dialog: scum. If Batman did wax these punks...SO
dialog: WHAT? They deserved it! End of
dialog: discussion.
scene_heading: INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING
text: ALFRED and VICKI arrive; BRUCE gestures for them to keep

speaker_heading: GORDON (O.S.; filter)
dialog: Anyone could've written that note.
scene_heading: INT. GORDON'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT

speaker_heading: CITY OFFICIAL I

speaker_heading: GORDON

speaker_heading: CITY OFFICIAL II
dialog: He's still a vigilante. We don't know who
dialog: he is, where he comes from, why he does
dialog: it...
speaker_heading: CITY OFFICIAL I
dialog: Street punks are one thing, Jim. This is
dialog: Walter Barrett -- a personal friend of
dialog: mine!
text: As the conversation continues, CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES IN ON a

scene_heading: INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT - ON BRUCE

speaker_heading: CITY OFFCIAL II

text: MORE SQUAD CARS scream down the cross street, joining in the
text: pursuit. All at once THICK BLACK SMOKE billows from the back
text: of the Batmobile -- ENVELOPING the police cars, BLINDING THE
dialog: DRIVERS...
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: TWO SQUAD CARS parked in a V-formation -- a makeshift
text: roadblock. ANXIOUS POLICEMEN mill about in front of them.
text: They move into position as the BATMOBILE, still trailing
text: smoke, rounds a corner and careens directly toward them...
scene_heading: ANGLE ON BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT
text: The FRONT FENDER of the Batmobile detaches and EXTENDS itself
text: from the body of the car. It BENDS in the middle; WING-PANELS
text: flip into place, forming an arrowhead-shaped COW-CATCHER.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - ON ROADBLOCK
text: A SHRIEKING HORN BLARES. The COPS see the Batmobile SPEEDING
text: UP and dive for the sidewalk. The COW-CATCHER slams into the
text: SOUAD CARS, pushes them effortlessly aside, and cruises
text: through the gap.
text: As the PURSUING CARS emerge from the smoke cloud and follow
text: the Batmobile through, we TILT UP to the roof of a nearby
dialog: building --
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT
text: -- and realize that the Batmobile's on automatic pilot,
dialog: because BATMAN's been on the roof all along -- watching the
text: action with some dismay.
text: His relationship with the Gotham PD appears to be on shaky
text: ground. He speaks into his voice-activated REMOTE CONTROL
speaker_heading: UNIT:
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Evasive.
text: SIRENS HOWL below as he strolls across the rooftop, lost in
dialog: thought.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: At this height, the SIRENS are a distant insect drone. We're
text: in the palatial digs of RANDALL SHAW, the construction
dialog: magnate. There's obviously money to be made in real-estate
text: development -- because the walls are lined with art, and the
text: floor-to-ceiling windows open on the most spectacular view in
dialog: Gotham.
text: At the moment, SHAW's posing casually in front of his new
text: Brancusi -- which rests on a pedestal near the windows. An
text: UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN in a slinky black dress LOOKS ON, her back
dialog: to the camera...
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: It's a fake.
speaker_heading: SHAW
dialog: Hmm. It cost me a half a million dollars.
dialog: You're sure?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Absolutely. You see, I...happen to know
text: where the real one is stashed.
text: The WOMAN wanders out of frame as SHAW smiles, impressed. He
text: seems peculiarly nonchalant about the whole deal; at the
text: moment, art is not the first thing on his mind. CAMERA STAYS
text: ON HIM as he pours two glasses of red wine and circles in on
text: his mysterious guest.
speaker_heading: SHAW
dialog: I guess you'd know. I have some "friends"
dialog: in the art world. They say that -- for
dialog: certain hard-to-get items -- you're the
dialog: one to call.
speaker_heading: WOMAN (O.S.)
dialog: How flattering.
speaker_heading: SHAW
dialog: They say for the right price...you could
dialog: steal Michelangelo off the Sistine Chapel
dialog: Wall.
speaker_heading: WOMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Mr. Shaw. Do you believe everything you
dialog: hear?
speaker_heading: SHAW
dialog: Oh, I'm not one to judge. I admire people
dialog: who take what they want. I'm just curious
dialog: how you do it.
text: SHAW hands her the wine, and for the first time we see her
text: face. It's SELINA KYLE, perching seductively on the arm of
dialog: the sofa...
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I find that the old methods work best.
text: Setting her wine down, flashing her patented Cheshire-cat
text: smile, SELINA moves in on him -- and they go into a deep,
text: passionate kiss. Her long red nails dig into his back; SHAW
text: drops his wine glass, which SHATTERS -- splashing red wine
text: across the polished parquet floor.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE - SHAW'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: The action's gone horizontal. SELINA, peeled down to a sheer
text: lace teddy, is on the bed atop SHAW -- tickling his throat
text: with quick, lapping kisses. She rolls off suddenly; when he
text: tries to sit up, she pushes him back down with a single
dialog: finger.
text: Sitting on the edge of the bed, she peels off her STOCKINGS,
text: twisting them around into tight cords. With a coy smile she
text: runs her finger in a circle around SHAW's hairy chest -- and
text: then, abruptly, knots one stocking tightly about his wrist and
text: ties it off on the bedpost.
speaker_heading: SHAW
dialog: Hey, what are you doing -- ?
text: He tries to break her grip. She BACKHANDS him sharply across
text: the face.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: You're very inquisitive. You'll just have
dialog: to be disciplined.
text: An EDGY SMILE spreads across his face as she binds his other
text: hand to the bedpost. None too quick, he's just caught on that
text: all this is part of SELINA's kinky scene. She crosses quickly
dialog: to the bathroom --
speaker_heading: SHAW
dialog: You know, I've...I've never really done
dialog: this kind of thing before.
text: -- and reemerges wearing her CATWOMAN mask...which seems
dialog: perfectly appropriate in this context.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I think people should indulge their
dialog: fantasies. Don't you?
text: Now that he's all trussed up, she crosses the room and reaches
text: into an oversized bag. She withdraws an odd-looking chromium
text: BRACE, slips it on over her wrist, and hits a trigger. SIX-
text: INCH STEEL TALONS snick into place. SHAW's dopey smile
text: fades...
speaker_heading: SHAW
dialog: Hey, what are those -- what are you --
text: He lets out an awful, shrill SHRIEK as the camera WHIP PANS
text: away from the bed to a Jackson Pollack on the wall nearby. A
text: SPRAY OF BLOOD spatters across it -- in an aesthetically
text: pleasing way -- and the SHRIEK ends in a LOW GURGLE as we
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BUILDING LOBBY - A FEW MINUTES LATER - NIGHT
text: A SECURITY GUARD is working a crossword at his booth near the
text: entrance of the building. Behind him, a bank of MONITORS show
text: various empty hallways throughout the building. He reaches
text: for his coffee and sees a RED LIGHT flashing on a wall panel
dialog: nearby.
scene_heading: INT. SHAW'S PENTHOUSE - THAT MOMENT
text: The penthouse is THROBBING with the clangorous sound of a
text: BURGLAR ALARM. SELINA is standing by an OPEN WALL SAFE --
text: concealed behind a painting, which has been swung away on
text: hinges -- and she's HOLDING HER EARS, wearing a look of
text: complete exasperation: oh, shit. The GUARD'S VOICE crackles
text: over a nearby intercom:
speaker_heading: GUARD (O.S.; filter)
dialog: Mr. Shaw? What's going on up there? --
dialog: Mr. Shaw?
text: Furious with herself, she reaches inside the safe and extracts
text: a BLACK RAVEN statuette -- identical to the one she took on
text: the docks. She slams the door shut and swings the picture
text: back into place.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: SIRENS echo in the streets. SQUAD CARS make sudden turns and
text: streak off toward SHAW's building.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT
text: Watching the cars from his rooftop vantage, BATMAN raises an
text: ANTENNA mounted on his utility belt and cups one hand to his
text: head. An EARPIECE concealed inside his cowl gives him the
dialog: police frequency:
speaker_heading: DISPATCHER (O.S.; filter)
dialog: -- possible 15 in progress, 188 E. 69th at
dialog: Gotham Park West. Move out. It's Randall
dialog: Shaw. Repeat, all units --
text: BATMAN's eyes widen. He steps to the ledge and pulls a TINY
text: METAL CYLINDER from his belt -- immediately recognizable as
text: part of BRUCE's hydraulic umbrella-gizmo.
text: But it's no umbrella. When BATMAN thumbs the switch, his
text: BLACK CAPE begins to SPREAD and RISE -- stiffening, expanding
text: -- INFLATING itself into a pair of RIGID BLACK BATWINGS.
text: He steps OFF THE LEDGE, INTO MIDAIR -- SOARING SILENTLY ACROSS
text: THE STREET LIKE A HUMAN HANG-GLIDER as the cop cars cruise
text: past far below.
scene_heading: INT. SHAW'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: There's an awful BANGING at the front door. SHAW lies under
text: the bloody sheets, hands folded, staring lifelessly up at the
text: ceiling. SELINA, now dressed in full Catwoman regalia, slings
text: a lightweight KNAPSACK over her shoulders. She picks up the
text: nearest chair, RAMS IT through SHAW's plate-glass window, and
text: clambers out onto the ledge outside.
text: Ten seconds later the COPS burst in. They rush to the bedroom
text: -- spot the shattered window, the inert gory mass on the
dialog: bed --
text: -- but the real shock comes when they glance over at the wall.
text: Painted there, in blood...is a big, red, dripping BAT.
speaker_heading: COP
speaker_heading: JESUS!
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - SHAW'S BUILDING - NIGHT
text: Forty stories up. The CATWOMAN, in a surefooted crouch, she
text: scurries along the ledge -- SPRINGS at a cornice -- and in one
text: lithe motion VAULTS UP onto the ROOF. She scampers across the
text: rooftops, dropping from one to the next with rope and tackle,
dialog: like a mountain climber --
text: -- until she reaches the building at the end of the block.
text: Here she pauses to dig in her knapsack. She pulls out a
text: retractable HOOK at the end of a rope, swings it around,
text: HEAVES IT at the rooftop across the street...
scene_heading: EXT. STREET BELOW - LOW ANGLE - THAT MOMENT
text: POLICE pile out of cars and race for the entrance, totally
text: oblivious to the odd scene taking place overhead -- where the
text: small, barely-visible figure of a WOMAN, clad entirely in
text: black leather, is doing a TIGHTROPE WALK across the
dialog: intersection.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - A MINUTE LATER - NIGHT
text: The CATWOMAN bounds across snowy rooftops until she decides
text: she's out of danger. Then, weary and exhilarated, she drops
text: to her knees; bathed in moonlight, she preens, stretches,
text: emits eerie little purrs and hisses of pleasure. She's just
text: made a kill and her blood is running high, so she's stopped
text: for a moment of Quality Time.
text: She hears an odd crunching noise two roofs over. Her whole
text: body tenses and -- though her head doesn't move -- her eyes
dialog: dart left.
text: A CAPED SHADOW has just touched down at the end of a line.
text: The gold BAT-EMBLEM on his chest is visible for the briefest
text: of seconds before he steps back into the shadows. She acts
text: like she hasn't noticed...
text: ...but a little smile flickers across her lips just the same.
scene_heading: TIGHT ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT
text: His eyes widen -- his LIPS PART as he watches her. If it's
dialog: possible to see absolute consternation behind that mask, we're
text: seeing it now.
scene_heading: HIS POV - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT
text: She still doesn't let on that she's seen him. Instead, she
text: goes to the ledge of the roof and begins to STRUT, like a
text: gymnast on the balance beam -- POSING for him in a little
text: private show -- a strange, self-infatuated, AUTOEROTIC DANCE
text: ROUTINE for BATMAN's benefit.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT
text: His jaw is down around his knees. Whoa. He edges forward
text: slightly, as if hypnotically drawn to her...
text: She hears a noise. Stops. Makes a big show of looking left
text: and right. Somehow afraid she'll see him watching, BATMAN
text: jumps back into the shadows. She gathers her things; a small
text: WHITE CARD flutters from her knapsack to the snowy roof, and
text: she VANISHES over the edge.
text: Snapping back to reality, he bolts across the roof just in
dialog: time to see --
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE OF BUILDING - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: She's rapidly working her way down the side of the building,
text: flipping down from one fire escape to tile next -- a master
text: gymnast. Three stories up, she lands on a railing, then STOPS
text: -- LAUNCHING HERSELF out over the street, making a perfect
text: landing on the roof of a passing BUS.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: BATMAN turns -- and his eyes fall on the WHITE CARD. He
text: kneels to pick it up; a brief three-word MESSAGE is scrawled
dialog: upon it...
text: LOOKING FOR LOVE?
text: He goes goggle-eyed with astonishment. He rushes back to the
text: edge of the roof and sees the BUS just turning toward the
text: entrance to Gotham Park. He's reaching for his grappling-gun,
text: figuring to follow, when a FLOODLIGHT catches him full in the
dialog: face.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS BELOW - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: Down below, the cops are sweeping their beams across the
text: rooftops. Two of them catch a quick glimpse of BATMAN just as
text: he ducks back behind the cornice, out of view.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Hey. You see what I saw...?
text: This sends the astounded COPS rushing to their radios. Right
text: on cue, COMMISSIONER GORDON's car pulls up. LT. BULLOCK,
text: who's already on the scene, fills him in as he climbs out.
speaker_heading: BULLOCK
dialog: It's Randall Shaw. Torn to ribbons. --
dialog: We just made Batman up on the roof.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Oh God.
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM PARK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: The BUS rumbles deeper into the snowy park. A BLACK
text: SILHOUETTE springs off the roof into the trees, disappearing
dialog: among the branches...
text: We TRACK WITH the bus as it moves through the park, arriving
dialog: finally at:
scene_heading: EXT. CLEARING IN PARK - SHANTYTOWN - NIGHT
text: The little colony of HOMELESS PEOPLE in their cardboard shacks
text: and lean-tos, still occupying the future site of the Park
text: Towers. MARCHERS and PICKETERS are continuing their protest
text: nearby, and some charitable organization's set up a makeshift
text: soup kitchen on folding tables -- hot coffee and sandwiches.
text: VICKI's on the periphery of the camp, camera in hand. She's
text: trying to persuade a HOMELESS MAN to let his picture be taken.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Please, just one. It's important for
dialog: people to see what's happening.
speaker_heading: HOMELESS MAN
dialog: They don't want to see us, lady. They
dialog: just want us gone -- out of sight, and out
dialog: of mind.
dialog: <i>(mumbling as he wanders off)</i>
dialog: Get worse before it gets better. It
dialog: always does.
text: VICKI TURNS. In the distance, the PICKETERS are shrieking and
text: wailing. A VAN's just pulled up to the edge of the park, and
text: a dozen HARDHATS are elbowing their way through the crowd.
text: All at once they're swarming through shantytown with TIRE
text: IRONS and BASEBALL BATS, overturning the sandwich tables,
text: RIPPING DOWN the shabby tents and lean-tos.
text: Some of the HOMELESS PEOPLE run. Those who resist meet with
text: swift and sudden violence. A MARCHER jumps a hardhat, and
text: gets a baseball bat in the gut for his trouble.
text: VICKI waits for the police sirens, but they don't come. She
text: backs off toward the trees, she begins SNAPPING PHOTOS
text: FRANTICALLY, capturing the carnage on film.
text: A HARDHAT is dismantling a lean-to with his tire iron --
text: sending the terrified family inside scurrying off into the
text: snow -- when he glances up and sees VICKI taking his picture.
text: He points her out to a colleague...
text: ...and suddenly the two of them are RUSHING TOWARD HER with
text: pure cold malice in their eyes. VICKI turns to run, but it's
text: slow going in the snow. She SLIPS and FALLS; her attackers
text: are almost upon her...
text: ...when a SHADOWY FIGURE DIVES OUT OF THE TREES and TACKLES
text: one of the HARDHATS. The FIGURE lands a powerhouse blow to
text: the fallen HARDHATs jaw, knocking him out cold.
text: The second HARDHAT turns and lifts his TIRE IRON. But the
text: FIGURE, with surprising agility, is already rolling out of the
text: way. As he rolls, he grabs the first guy's HARDHAT off his
text: head and brings it up in front of him -- blocking the blow
text: from the second guy's tire iron.
text: In the same motion, he plants a FOOT in the second HARDHAT's
text: belly and sends him REELING BACKWARD, HARDHAT II drops the
text: tire iron, and the FIGURE snatches it out of midair as he gets
text: to his feet. He moves in on the second HARDHAT, BRANDISHING
dialog: the iron --
text: -- and while HARDHAT II is staring at it, the FIGURE HIGH-
text: KICKS HIM in the face. HOP; KICK. HOP; KICK. The FIGURE has
text: nailed him three times squarely on the jaw before he can hit
dialog: the ground.
text: The FIGURE turns toward VICKI. Her eyes go wide with
dialog: astonishment.
text: It's a KID, thirteen or fourteen at the outside, sunken-eyed,
text: grimy-looking, in a torn-and-tattered RAINCOAT. She stares at
text: him for the briefest of instants before he rushes off to the
dialog: aid of his fellow homeless...
text: She can't believe what she's seeing. The KID wades smack into
text: the midst of the remaining HARDHATS, and kicks ass --
text: spinning, pirouetting, kicking, clawing in a furious display
text: of pure athleticism. It seems like he's everywhere at once.
dialog: There's only one other guy in Gotham City who can handle
dialog: himself like this...
text: Rallying behind him, the MARCHERS and HOMELESS PEOPLE snatch
text: bats and tire irons from the fallen HARDHATS -- and the tide
text: turns. The invasion is being repelled. Faced with renewed
text: resistance, the few HARDHATS still left standing TURN TAIL and
text: race off to their VAN.
text: Triumph in shantytown. The MARCHERS and HOMELESS cluster
text: together to lick their wounds -- and the KID, satisfied that
text: everything is under control, turns and sprints off toward the
dialog: trees.
text: But one prostrate HARDHAT is only playing dead. As the KID
text: runs past, the HARDHAT extends a TIRE IRON into his path --
text: TRIPPING HIM, sending him sprawling in the snow. The KID
text: throws up his hands as the HARDHAT prepares to smash down at
dialog: him...
text: CLANG. The HARDHAT drops his tire iron and topples over,
text: BOARDLIKE. The KID looks up and sees VICKI standing there
text: with a baseball bat.
text: He gives her a quick nod of acknowledgement as he gets to his
text: feet -- thanks for returning the favor. He's about to light
dialog: out again when --
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: WAIT! Don't be afraid. I wanted to thank
dialog: you. I --
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: <i>(cautiously)</i>
dialog: Twenty.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Twenty bucks.
text: VICKI's mildly taken aback, but she reaches for her purse just
text: the same. She's barely gotten her wallet open when the KID
text: snatches the bill out of her hands. They stare at each other
dialog: for a long moment --
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: ...Who are you?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Dick.
text: -- and then he's bounding off like a shot. VAULTING up into a
text: tree and vanishing amid the snowy branches. VICKI starts to
text: follow, but there's no way she can keep up. Instead she digs
text: into her CAMERA BAG...
scene_heading: HER POV - THROUGH TELEPHOTO LENS
text: Using the long lens, she tracks the KID's progress through the
text: treetops. She can't actually see him, but occasional chunks
text: of SNOW and ICE are falling to the ground as he jumps from
dialog: limb to limb...
text: For a moment it seems like she's lost him. As she sweeps the
text: lens back and forth, scanning the trees, she catches sight of
text: an EQUESTRIAN STATUE in the distance. She ups the
text: magnification so she can see the plaque on the pedestal. The
text: stone figure on the horse is Union war hero GEN. OLIVER WAYNE
dialog: -- BRUCE's great-grandfather.
text: As luck would have it, the KID drops to earth not ten feet
text: from the statue -- VICKI's got him in her sights again. He
text: looks around cautiously to make sure no one's following, then
text: races toward a STONE BRIDGE which arches between two small
text: hillocks, over a frozen creek.
text: There's a DRAINAGE TUNNEL, four or five feet in diameter,
text: mounted in the bridge abutment, the KID pries off a wire grate
text: and clambers inside, then pulls the grate back into place
text: behind him. Home sweet home.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK - ON VICKI - NIGHT
text: as she lowers the lens. Her face is full of conflicting
dialog: emotions. She'd love to corner this boy vigilante and find
dialog: out what his story is. But on the other hand -- even the
dialog: homeless are entitled to their privacy...

scene_heading: INT. PENGUIN'S AVIARY - NIGHT
text: A CANARY sings in its cage as a BLACK CAT watches transfixed
text: from a nearby chair. The cat arches its back -- waits -- and
text: SPRINGS AT THE CAGE, BATTING at it in midair. The canary
text: SHRIEKS; the cat YOWLS; a WOMAN snatches it up off the floor,
text: cradles it in her arms...
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: Now Hecate. You don't want that scrawny
dialog: little bird --
text: It's SELINA, looking ripe and slinky in a sheer black
text: ensemble. At the desk behind her is the PENGUIN, in his
text: customary cutaway and waist-coat, polishing his new RAVEN. He
text: bares his teeth:
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Do you want me to wring that creature's
dialog: neck?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: You try it, I'll do the same to you.
dialog: <i>(as he grumbles; bemused)</i>
dialog: I saw him, you know.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Saw who?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Batman. He was dreamy.
text: She strokes the cat, in a reverie. The PENGUIN drops his
text: polishing cloth, startled.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Dreamy?!? Are you insane!? My God --
dialog: <i>(sputtering wildly)</i>
dialog: Are you sure it was him? What did he do?
speaker_heading: SELINA
text: He stood on a roof and watched me. He
dialog: didn't realize I'd seen him. I don't
dialog: think he knew quite what to make of me.
dialog: <i>(smiling)</i>
dialog: But he was definitely interested.
text: This sends the PENGUIN into a frantic round of pacing. (Or
dialog: waddling.)
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: This scheme of yours is backfiring. We
dialog: don't need him on our tails. Do you know
dialog: how much money is at stake here?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Money isn't everything.
dialog: <i>(casually)</i>
dialog: What's the point if we can't enjoy
dialog: ourselves?

speaker_heading: SQUAWKS.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - MORNING
dialog: The big SIGN over Gotham Square tells us there are only 9

speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Six-on-one, and he took 'em all out...then
dialog: vanished into a drainage pipe -- right
text: next to the statue of General Wayne.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: My illustrious great-grandfather. Think
dialog: it's the same kid we heard about?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Must be. He reminded me of you.
text: BRUCE chuckles. They pass a NEWSSTAND just outside the Globe
text: building, pausing to stare at the headlines -- which SCREAM:
scene_heading: NEW BAT-MURDER?
text: Batman Suspect in Slaying of Millionaire Developer
dialog: Commissioner Gordon Refuses Comment
text: The accompanying photo is a full-color spread of the BLOODY

dialog: -- You work for this rag?
dialog: <i>(snatching up a paper)</i>
dialog: Your boss is calling for Gordon's

dialog: for questioning...
text: VICKI nudges BRUCE and points at a STOREFRONT across the

scene_heading: THEIR POV - SOUVENIR SHOP
text: The owner is in the store window, hastily removing all of his
text: Batman merchandise and setting up new displays devoted to
text: TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES and THE SIMPSONS. A MOTHER drags
text: her squirming TODDLER past the entrance -- the kid smells
text: heavy markdowns on Bat-shit, but Mom clearly doesn't
dialog: approve...
scene_heading: BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND VICKI
text: looking on in dismay. BRUCE crumples the paper in outrage:
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I need a good PR man.
speaker_heading: NEWS VENDOR
dialog: Hey, pal -- you buyin' or borrowin'?
text: With a sullen look, BRUCE tosses the paper back on the rack.
text: VICKI pulls him off toward the entrance of the Globe.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: That's what happens when you go after the
dialog: rich and powerful.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Hey, it wasn't me, remember? I am rich
dialog: and powerful --
text: As he's talking, BRUCE glances back at the newsstand. He sees
text: an AD FLYER tacked up on one side -- "LOOKING FOR LOVE? Find
text: it in the GOTHAM GLOBE PERSONALS."
text: Looking for Love. Eyes widening, he digs in his pocket for a
text: quarter and races back to the newsstand. VICKI keeps
dialog: walking...
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Maybe it's almost...good. In a weird way.
dialog: I mean, Shaw, and Barrett -- if people
dialog: like that were really scared, maybe
dialog: they'd --
text: She suddenly realizes she's talking to herself. She turns
text: around and sees BRUCE back at the newsstand, hurriedly
text: unfolding a copy of the Globe. She marches back and tugs at
dialog: his sleeve.
speaker_heading: VICKI (cont.)
dialog: Hey, I'm late for work. You can read that
dialog: later.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Quiet. I'm looking for a personal ad.
text: Her face screws up in confusion as BRUCE frantically scans the
dialog: page.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (cont.)
dialog: "Tall, Dark And Handsome -- You saw me on
dialog: the roof 12/16. I was in black; you were
dialog: too."
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Is this some kind of bad joke?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: It's her. That cat woman, or whatever she

speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: What does she want -- a date?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: She's trying to contact me. Says she's
dialog: gonna leave me another ad...
text: The two of them exchange a look of utter perplexity. BRUCE's

dialog: makes VICKI just a trifle nervous...
scene_heading: INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY
text: VICKI arrives at her desk and sets her portfolio down. She
text: spots a message in the "in" file. She takes one look at it,
text: and her eyes go wide with RAGE. She storms out in a fury...
scene_heading: INT. PUBLISHER'S OFFICE - A MINUTE LATER - DAY
text: Barging past a phalanx of SECRETARIES, VICKI bursts into the
text: inner office of HARRISON J. PROVOST, publisher of the Globe.
text: He's just opening his mail. He heaves a weary sigh as VICKI
text: BARKS at him:
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: WHY DID YOU KILL MY STORY?
speaker_heading: PROVOST
dialog: Close the door.
dialog: <i>(waiting for her to calm down)</i>
dialog: Your story isn't news. With Shaw dead --
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: But the project's still going ahead! If
dialog: attacking homeless people in the park
dialog: isn't news, I'd like to know what is --
speaker_heading: PROVOST
text: There's a psycho out there in a mask and
dialog: cape -- killing off Gotham's most
dialog: prominent citizens! That's news.
dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: I've known Randall Shaw all my life. His
text: family is in mourning. And it just so
dialog: happens I don't believe in slandering the
dialog: dead.
text: VICKI FUMES. She turns and stares PROVOST straight in the
dialog: eye.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Mr. Provost -- how much money do you have
dialog: tied up in the Park Tower project?
speaker_heading: PROVOST
dialog: Vicki...I'm going to forget you made that
dialog: remark. For the sake of your job, I
dialog: suggest you do the same.
text: VICKI stalks of -- and PROVOST goes back to his mail. He
text: finds an envelope addressed in a shaky, psychotic scrawl, with
text: the word "CONFIDENTIAL" underlined three times in ink. He
dialog: tears it open --
text: -- and HIS FACE TURNS PALE as he stares down at the contents:
text: a small business-sized card, signed with a BAT-EMBLEM...
text: THOSE WHO FEED ON THE SOUL OF GOTHAM
scene_heading: WILL SUFFER MY WRATH
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM HALL OF JUSTICE - DAY
text: WALTER BARRETT and his ATTORNEY emerge onto the front steps of
text: the courthouse. BARRETT is instantly mobbed by REPORTERS.
speaker_heading: REPORTER I
dialog: Mr. Barrett! Any comment on the
dialog: arraignment?
speaker_heading: REPORTER II
dialog: Is it true bail was set at two million
dialog: dollars?
speaker_heading: ATTORNEY
dialog: Stand back! My client has nothing to say
dialog: at this time!
text: The ATTORNEY clears a path for BARRETT, who climbs into a
text: waiting CAR, shielding his face. REPORTERS cluster around
dialog: it...
text: As the car pulls out into traffic, we see a flock of PIGEONS
text: taking wing from their perches on the statues outside the Hall
dialog: of Justice.
scene_heading: OVERHEAD SHOT - ON BARRETT'S CAR
text: PIGEONS fill the frame, swooping down toward the CAR, which is
text: idling at a traffic light far below.
scene_heading: INT. BARRETT'S CAR - THAT MOMENT
text: The liveried DRIVER drums his fingers as he waits for the
text: light to change. BARRETT's in the back, speaking into his
dialog: cellular phone.
speaker_heading: BARRETT
dialog: It's time we called an emergency meeting
dialog: of the Raven Society. Get back to me...
text: Looking troubled, he hangs up. A fat white glob of PIGEON
text: SHIT splatters across the windshield. Seconds later --
text: another SPLAT.
speaker_heading: BARRETT (cont.)
dialog: Damn pigeons.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Just washed it, too.
text: The DRIVER reaches for the wiper switch. They hear a tiny
text: DINK as a SOLID PELLET bounces off the windshield.
text: BARRETT and the DRIVER exchange a mystified look. A small,
text: blinking CAPSULE has just lodged in the wiper-blade
dialog: assembly...
scene_heading: OVERHEAD SHOT - ON BARRETT'S CAR
text: Just as the light changes, the CAR EXPLODES into a million
text: fragments -- leaving a BLACKENED CRATER in the middle of the
dialog: intersection.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BATCAVE - DAY
text: TIGHT ON A VIDEO MONITOR -- showing FIRE TRUCKS in the
text: intersection we've just left, hosing down the wreckage of
text: BARRETT's car. BRUCE is watching intently when ALFRED appears
text: behind him.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: The Fluegelheim called again, sir. They
dialog: want to know if you'll be attending the
text: opening of the new Egyptian exhibit.
text: BRUCE, still engrossed in his news broadcast, waves ALFRED
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Cancel.
speaker_heading: ANCHORWOMAN (on TV)
dialog: -- and, citing new evidence in the so-
dialog: called string of "millionaire murders,"
dialog: Police Commissioner J.T. Gordon today
dialog: swore out a warrant for the arrest of
dialog: Batman.
dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: We go now live to Mike Sekowsky,
dialog: spokesperson, Order of the Bat.
speaker_heading: SEKOWSKY
dialog: Jeez! Talk about gratitude -- !!
text: At the sight of SEKOWSKY's face, BRUCE kills the sound in
text: disgust. ALFRED looks on helplessly as he paces the floor of
dialog: the Batcave.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Well, Alfred, it's official. I'm a wanted
dialog: man.
dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: "New evidence"...I've gotta find that
dialog: woman. Did you check the personals?
text: As ALFRED shakes his head no, a BUZZER sounds. They've got a
text: visitor. BRUCE hits a switch on a monitor, and sees
text: COMMISSIONER GORDON'S CAR sitting outside the wrought-iron
text: gates of Wayne Manor.
text: He throws a nervous look at ALFRED. ALFRED speaks into a
dialog: microphone:
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Who's there?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Jim Gordon, Alfred. I've got to see
dialog: Bruce.
text: A spooky development. Does GORDON suspect? After a moment's
text: hesitation, BRUCE nods to ALFRED -- let him in.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Mr. Wayne will see you, sir.
scene_heading: INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER
text: A curious BRUCE ushers GORDON into the library, gestures
text: toward the liquor cabinet. The Commissioner nods his head no.
text: He's fidgety, ill at ease -- he obviously doesn't want to be
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Sorry to bother you. Bruce -- I'll get
dialog: right down to it. You knew Shaw and
dialog: Barrett --
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I saw them occasionally. We all sat on
dialog: the board of the Fluegelheim...
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Did you have any...dealings with them,
dialog: or --
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: No. I never liked the way they did
dialog: business.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: The thing is, Bruce, you're all lumped
dialog: together in the public mind -- the Five
dialog: Families of Gotham, that sort of thing --
dialog: and, uh...
dialog: <i>(taking a card from his pocket)</i>
dialog: Harrison Provost got this in the mail.
text: BRUCE examines the card, -- "THOSE WHO FEED," etc. He stares
text: at GORDON in mock-concern, playing it close to the vest...
speaker_heading: BRUCE
text: Then Batman is behind all this.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Batman or a damned good imitation.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Well. He's changed tactics, hasn't he.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: <i>(shrugging; at a loss)</i>
dialog: Shaw, with his high-rises -- Barrett, a
dialog: druglord, major polluter -- they weren't
dialog: exactly model citizens. Who knows, it
dialog: could be some crazy social-conscience kind
dialog: of thing.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: You mean he's going after...the root of
dialog: the problem.
text: GORDON shakes his head and gets up to go. BRUCE hands him the
dialog: card.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Let me know if you get one of these.
dialog: We'll put all our resources at your
dialog: disposal.
text: BRUCE nods thoughtfully as ALFRED appears to see the
text: Commissioner out. A moment later, the butler reappears.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Changed my mind, Alfred. I'll be dropping
dialog: in on the Fluegelheim after all.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. FLUEGELHEIM MUSEUM - NIGHT
text: It's a party to celebrate the opening of the new Egyptian
text: exhibit, and the Fluegelheim is hopping. BOARD MEMBERS,
text: MUSEUM PATRONS, and SOCIALITES mill about in dinner jackets
text: and evening gowns, making small talk. AN OPEN SARCOPHAGUS has
text: been set up as a wet bar.
text: On a raised concrete platform in the center of the hall,
text: rimmed by a decorative moat, sits an ancient Egyptian SHRINE.
text: The TEMPLE OF BASTET has been moved to Gotham and
text: reconstructed in the Fluegelheim --sandstone walls, fountains,
dialog: statuary and all.
text: Guarding the entrance is a stately bronze statue of the
text: goddess BASTET -- who has the body of a woman and the head of
text: a pointy-eared CAT. She holds an aegis and a sistrum; four
text: tiny KITTENS romp at her feet. BRUCE, who's just arrived, is
text: taking an intense interest in the cat-goddess...
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I just had a weird sense of <i>deja vu</i>.
text: He glances over by the sarcophagus and sees PROVOST, the
text: publisher, huddle with ELIOT TIPTREE III, transit magnate --
text: the remaining member of Gotham's "Five Families." The two of
text: them are engaged in some urgent conversation which he can't
dialog: quite make out...
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: Harrison -- we really ought to warn Bruce.
dialog: We owe him that much.
text: BRUCE detaches himself from VICKI and strolls toward them.
text: PROVOST and TIPTREE force smiles and wave, affecting an air of
text: nonchalance.
speaker_heading: PROVOST (cont.)
dialog: The man's a space cadet. Let him look out
dialog: for himself.
dialog: <i>(as BRUCE arrives; cheerfully)</i>
dialog: Why, Bruce! What a delightful surprise.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Good to see you two. Looks like the Five
text: Families are suddenly down to three.
dialog: <i>(looking around)</i>
dialog: In fact, if somebody dropped a bomb on
dialog: this room right now --
text: TIPTREE chuckles nervously. PROVOST is even less amused.
speaker_heading: PROVOST
dialog: Is that your idea of a joke, Bruce?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
text: Not at all. Commissioner Gordon seems to
dialog: think we should all be hiring bodyguards.
speaker_heading: TIPTREE PROVOST
dialog: Oh, that's absurd. I already have.
text: The two of them glower at each other. It's like an outtake
text: from <i>The Newlywed Game</i>. BRUCE shrugs it off and makes a
dialog: vacuous face:
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Thing is, I can't imagine why Batman would
dialog: be after us. Can you?
text: PROVOST and TIPTREE are about to go into another round of
text: hemming-and-hawing when a NEW FACE joins the party. It's
text: SELINA KYLE -- stunning as ever in an extravagantly revealing
text: dress slit up to the armpits. She's holding two glasses of
text: CHAMPAGNE...
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: You two look like you need a drink. --
dialog: And is this who I think it is?
text: She flashes BRUCE her most winning, seductive, heavy-artillery
text: SMILE. He BLINKS, temporarily speechless.
speaker_heading: PROVOST
dialog: Selina Kyle -- Bruce Wayne.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Our absentee board member! I've been
dialog: wanting to meet you forever.
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
text: Selina's the new Curator of Antiquities.
dialog: She brought the Temple over block by
dialog: block --
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: You two won't be terribly upset if I
dialog: borrow Bruce for a moment, will you?
text: Before he can protest, she's linked an arm around his and
text: dragged him off. A nearby FAT MAN spots SELINA, wiggles his
text: eyebrows and WAVES BRIGHTLY. His tongue is practically
text: hanging out -- he's just dying to write her a check. SELINA
scene_heading: SIGHS WEARILY to BRUCE:
speaker_heading: SELINA (cont.)
dialog: Major contributor. -- I always seem to
dialog: wind up in charge of fund-raising...
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I can't imagine why.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Tax year's almost over, you know. I hope
dialog: we can count on your usual generous
dialog: donation.
scene_heading: <i>(indicating PROVOST and TIPTREE)</i>
dialog: Someone's got to set an example for those
text: two tightwads.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: They're proccupied. This string of
dialog: murders --
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I asked them if they'd consider including
dialog: us in their wills.
dialog: <i>(chuckling to herself)</i>
dialog: They didn't seem a bit amused...
scene_heading: ANGLE ON VICKI - THAT MOMENT
text: She's making small talk with a bunch of STUFFED SHIRTS and
text: their overdressed WIVES. She glances across the room at the
text: statue of Bastet, sees SELINA draped all over BRUCE. A frown
text: crosses her face...
scene_heading: ANGLE ON BRUCE AND SELINA - THAT MOMENT
text: She's still clinging to his arm as they stare up at the
dialog: statue.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: -- and this is my good friend Bastet, the
dialog: Egyptian Cat Goddess.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I think we've already met. -- This is
dialog: quite an expedition you've put together.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I'm glad you think so. I have to say,
dialog: Bruce -- you're not at all what I
dialog: expected.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Sorry to disappoint you.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Oh, it's not that. Not at all. It's just
dialog: that I'd always heard you were...
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: <i>(coyly)</i>
dialog: Oh...sort of a...
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: <i>(smiling; fascinated)</i>
dialog: No. Come on. What?
text: BRUCE's state of mounting infatuation is abruptly shattered
text: when VICKI sidles up alongside him and -- territorially --
text: takes his other arm. The women exchange big, toothy, plastic
text: smiles; stranded in the middle, BRUCE realizes they're waiting
dialog: for him to introduce them.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Oh. Selina Kyle -- my friend Vicki Vale.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: The photographer. I've seen your pictures
dialog: in the Gazette.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: The Globe.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Oh, that's right. The tabloid one. --
dialog: What an original dress!
text: VICKI, still smiling, cocks an eyebrow at BRUCE. He senses
text: trouble coming and tries to head it off at the pass.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Selina supervised the reconstruction of
dialog: the temple. Brought it back from Egypt...
text: stone by stone.
speaker_heading: VICKI
text: Really. She must be awfully tired.
scene_heading: <i>(to SELINA)</i>
dialog: How'd you get to be in charge of a huge
dialog: project like this?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: It was easy. I slept with the Pharoah.
text: She laughs at her own joke. VICKI responds with a dry little
text: chuckle of her own. SELINA gives BRUCE a SHARP YANK on the
dialog: sleeve.
speaker_heading: SELINA (cont.)
dialog: Excuse us, won't you, sweetheart? We have
dialog: some boring museum business to talk about.
text: VICKI fumes. BRUCE shrugs apologetically as SELINA drags him
text: off out of earshot.
speaker_heading: SELINA (cont.)
dialog: I. Short leash.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Pull in the claws, okay? She's really
dialog: terrific.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I'm sorry, Bruce. Sometimes I get a
dialog: little...aggressive, you know?
dialog: <i>(handing him a card)</i>
dialog: Look, I need to talk to you. Come by
dialog: sometime. I'll give you the private tour.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Wait. Let me explain about Vicki --
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: <i>(shushing him)</i>
dialog: I understand. Anyone who's that
dialog: protective must have a pretty good reason
dialog: for it.
text: She shoots him one last smile -- sly, conspiratorial,
text: unmistakably juicy. Then she's off in pursuit of another
text: major funder. BRUCE is thoughtfully turning the card over in
text: his hands when VICKI rejoins him.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: How's "business"?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Relax, okay? I like you better.
text: He scans the room, trying to find PROVOST and TIPTREE. No
dialog: luck.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: If you're looking for your fellow
dialog: millionaires, they left some time back.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT
text: The roof of the Gotham Globe. A STARLING circles overhead for
text: a moment -- then DIVES down an exposed VENTILATION SHAFT.
scene_heading: INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - THAT MOMENT
text: TWO ARMED BODYGUARDS are standing watch outside an office.
text: Brass letters on the door read "J. HARRISON PROVOST,
scene_heading: PUBLISHER."
scene_heading: INT. PROVOST'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT
text: PROVOST, agitated, working late. He speaks, <i>sotto voce</i>, into
dialog: the phone:
speaker_heading: PROVOST
dialog: Don't worry about that. I've had the
dialog: office swept for bugs. No one's
dialog: listening...
scene_heading: INT. TIPTREE'S LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: TIPTREE in his paneled study at home. There's an open bottle
text: on the table and he's been hitting the sauce -- hard. His
speaker_heading: VOICE QUAVERS:
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: It's just so -- unfair. I mean...it was
dialog: over a century ago. It's not like we're
dialog: responsible.
dialog: <i>(hollow-eyed)</i>
dialog: How could he know? How could Batman know
dialog: about the Raven Society??
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - ON PROVOST - THAT MOMENT
speaker_heading: PROVOST
dialog: Who knows and who cares. The point is,
dialog: it's happened...
text: He hears a CHIRP and looks up. It seems to be coming from a
text: HEATING VENT on the wall. But then it stops, so he resumes
dialog: his conversation --
speaker_heading: PROVOST (cont.)
dialog: I'm clearing out of the country, and I'm
dialog: taking the raven with me. I suggest you
dialog: do the same.
scene_heading: INT. HEATING VENT - THAT MOMENT
text: In the metal shaft on the other side of the grate is a tiny
text: BIRD -- the same one we saw flying down the air shaft. Now
text: that we've got a close-up view, we can see the thin BATTERY
text: PACK wired to its underbelly...and the MINIATURE MICROPHONE
text: taped to its leg.
speaker_heading: PROVOST (O.S.)
dialog: I'll tell you how to reach me. And don't
dialog: repeat this to anyone.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - DAY
text: The PENGUIN stands over his indoor penguin pool. He's wearing
text: rubber gloves, feeding LIVE FISH from an ice chest to his
text: arctic birds. The vents in the windows are open, and the
text: climate in the room is downright icy as SELINA's wrapped in
text: fur, stroking her pet cat:
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: He's just another rich idiot.
dialog: <i>(chuckling to herself)</i>
dialog: The odd thing is, he didn't seem a bit
dialog: concerned.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Then he is an idiot.
speaker_heading: SELINA
text: He lives in some big sprawling manor.
dialog: I'll have to get inside, scope it out...
dialog: see where he's got the raven stashed.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: How do you plan to do that?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: How do you think!
text: A feline smile from SELINA. The PENGUIN chuckles to himself,
text: lobs a FISH out over the pool. A swooping GULL snatches it
text: out of the air before it hits the water. FRICK arrives in the
dialog: doorway.
speaker_heading: FRICK
dialog: It's Mr. Provost, sir. He's planning to
text: embark on an unscheduled Christmas
dialog: vacation.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Good! That should save us a trip to the
dialog: bank.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. FLUEGELHEIM - BACK ROOM - DAY
text: A huge open room cluttered with all kinds of junk:
text: archaeologist's tools, restoration equipment, etc., plus a
text: healthy assortment of curios and oddities from all over. This
text: is SELINA's private domain. CAMERA TRACKS past a glass case
text: full of ugly, withered, turdlike specimens...
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What have we got here?
speaker_heading: SELINA
text: Mummified cats. Bastet's sacred animal.
dialog: They were buried by the thousands at
dialog: Bubastis. -- Oh, careful!
text: BRUCE FREEZES with his hand poised over a set of four earthen
text: JARS. Each has a lid carved in the shape of a HEAD: ape,
dialog: jackal, man, falcon.
speaker_heading: SELINA (cont.)
text: Canopic jars. In the process of
dialog: mummification, the internal organs were
text: buried separately.
dialog: <i>(pointing to each jar in turn)</i>
dialog: Lungs -- stomach -- liver -- intestine --
text: BRUCE withdraws his hand with a bemused shudder.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: You're in a gruesome line of work.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Keeps me interested. And that's not easy
dialog: to do...
text: BRUCE's attention turns to a crumbling statuette of an odd
text: beast: a WINGED LION with the head of a FALCON.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: This one I know. It's a gryphon, right?
speaker_heading: SELINA
text: Very good. A mythical demon, half-bird,
text: half-lion...sweeping down from the sky to
dialog: deliver retribution and justice.
text: BRUCE nods. He can dig it. He regards the gryphon for a long
text: moment and CHUCKLES.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Poor guy. Birds and cats -- you wouldn't
dialog: think the two halves would cooperate.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Only under certain circumstances.
dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: I'm really glad you came, Bruce. I was
dialog: afraid I'd given you the wrong impression.
dialog: Or maybe it was the right impression.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What was it you wanted to talk to me
dialog: about?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Your collection. I'd love to see it. I
dialog: mean, everyone says you've got a
dialog: fabulous --
text: She breaks off in midstream and chuckles to herself. She toys
text: demurely with her equipment. She looks up at BRUCE and
text: switches tactics -- going for the direct approach. BRUCE
dialog: braces himself...
speaker_heading: SELINA (cont.)
dialog: Mainly I just wanted an excuse to see you
dialog: again. Does she know you're here --
dialog: Vicki?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: <i>(shrugging)</i>
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: It must be strange. Having all that
dialog: power, and money -- never really knowing
dialog: if that's what people are attracted to.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What are you attracted to?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I think you're a little bit nuts.
dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: I think you're a little -- bored with your
dialog: life. Having everything you want. No
dialog: variety, no...danger. And every once in a
dialog: while you need to take a risk. Shake it
dialog: all up.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Maybe by...coming here today.
text: She leans back against a crate, moistens her lips. She's
text: letting him have it with both barrels.
speaker_heading: SELINA (cont.)
dialog: That's one thing I can give you, Bruce --
dialog: danger -- a little something you can't get
text: at home.
text: BRUCE hesitates -- but the lure is irresistible. He moves
text: forward slowly; SELINA's eyes close; their lips draw slowly
dialog: closer...
text: ...and he SNEEZES IN HER FACE. She backs off in shock as he
text: covers his face. His eyes are watering and he's WHEEZING.
text: She rushes over --
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Is there a cat in here?
text: Right on cue, SELINA's black cat HECATE lets out a loud MEOW
text: -- and STRETCHES against BRUCE's pants leg. He brushes the
text: animal aside and it LEAPS into SELINA's arms. BRUCE sniffles
text: uncontrollably.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (cont.)
dialog: Get it away!
text: She drops the cat, which scampers off. BRUCE rubs his eyes.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Poor thing. You're allergic!
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Yeah, cats...ever since I was a kid...
dialog: <i>(snorting and weeping)</i>
dialog: Look, I'd better get some fresh air.
dialog: Maybe another time, okay...
text: He heads for the door before SELINA can stop him. He's gone,
text: but she knows she's left a dent in his armor. She smiles in
text: bemusement as HECATE jumps into her arms and PURRS.
scene_heading: EXT. FLUEGELHEIM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY
text: BRUCE stumbles out the museum feeling mildly discombobulated.
text: He marches down the front steps past a NEWSSTAND -- where he
text: stops to buy a copy of the afternoon GLOBE.
text: He opens it to the PERSONAL ADS and finds what he's been
dialog: waiting for:
text: TALL, DARK, AND HANDSOME -- Christmas is coming.
dialog: Why don't we trim the tree together?
text: This puzzles him for a moment -- until he looks up the street.
text: In the distance, at the very center of Gotham Square, WORKMEN
text: are stringing lights around an enormous CHRISTMAS TREE, almost
text: fifty feet tall.
text: The LIGHTING CEREMONY is an annual event in Gotham. BRUCE
text: smiles slightly, tucks the paper under one arm and walks to
dialog: his car.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - NIGHT
text: SNOW falls on a huge CROWD gathered around the big tree. The
text: tree won't be lit for another twenty minutes or so, and so the
text: ONLOOKERS are singing CHRISTMAS CAROLS from printed lyric
dialog: sheets.
text: A BAND is playing on a makeshift ORCHESTRA PLATFORM erected in
text: front of the tree, leading the crowd in a spirited rendition
text: of "God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen." The Square is rocking with
dialog: good will toward men. When they get to the part about saving
dialog: us all from Satan's power --
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: -- the CAMERA TILTS UPWARD to BATMAN, watching the action from
text: his usual gargoyle's perch. He's scanning the streets and the
text: rooftops, waiting tor the CATWOMAN to make her move --
dialog: whatever it is.
text: He glances at the building directly across the square from
text: him. On the roof is a neon sign reading Gotham City Globe in
text: ornate old-English letters -- and above that, a ROTATING METAL
text: SCULPTURE of the world turning. His eyes rove downward along
text: the facade of the building...
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM GLOBE - THAT MOMENT
text: At street level, an ARMORED CAR has pulled up in front of the
text: Globe offices. THREE SECURITY GUARDS with rifles climb out of
text: the ARMORED CAR, followed by a FOURTH -- who has an OBLONG BOX
text: handcuffed to his wrist. Of course, we can't see what's
dialog: inside, but to those of us in the know the box looks just
text: about the right size for a RAVEN STATUETTE.
text: The GUARDS scan the street and enter the building without
text: incident. As they do, a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN crosses the
text: frame; mounted on its side is an ADVERTISING PLACARD which
dialog: reads:
scene_heading: BATMAN: HERO OR MENACE?
dialog: Read All About It in the GOTHAM GLOBE!
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN
text: He watches with some curiosity. An armored car: is this some
text: part of the CATWOMAN's scheme? But no...the GUARDS are safely
text: inside the building, and the CAR is leaving. He settles back
dialog: to wait.
scene_heading: INT. NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN - THAT MOMENT
text: The innocuous-looking VAN rounds the corner of the Globe
text: building. FRICK is at the wheel, FRACK is riding shotgun, and
text: the PENGUIN is between them, peering out eagerly through the
dialog: windshield.
text: They turn into the Globe's BASEMENT GARAGE -- where dozens of
text: similar vans are parked at the LOADING BAYS. Just part of the
dialog: fleet...
scene_heading: INT. PROVOST'S OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER
text: The quartet of SECURITY GUARDS arrive at PROVOST's office.
text: The publisher has already packed his suitcases for a speedy
text: getaway. The LEAD GUARD -- the one cuffed to the RAVEN BOX --
text: sets his precious cargo on a desk and stands discreetly at
text: arm's length while PROVOST unlocks it and checks its contents.
text: Satisfied, he slams it shut. He reaches into his top drawer
text: for an ENVELOPE, which he hands to his PERSONAL SECRETARY.
speaker_heading: PROVOST
dialog: Open this in an hour. Phone my wife and
dialog: tell her where to meet me.
dialog: <i>(to the GUARDS; edgily)</i>
dialog: No trouble on the way, I take it?
speaker_heading: LEAD GUARD
dialog: No sir, Mr. Provost. We came straight
text: from the bank vault.
speaker_heading: GUARD II
dialog: 'Copter should be just touching down.
dialog: We'll have you safely out of here in no
dialog: time.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN
text: "Here Comes Santa Claus" echoes up from the streets. BATMAN
text: watches as a COPTER descends toward the HELIPAD on the roof of
dialog: the Globe...
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER
text: PROVOST and the LEAD GUARD with the raven box are at an
text: elevator bank. The other GUARDS head for a stairwell.
speaker_heading: GUARD II
dialog: We'll check the stairs. See you on the
dialog: roof.
text: The LEAD GUARD starts to press the UP button, but PROVOST
text: pulls a key from his pocket instead:
speaker_heading: PROVOST
dialog: No -- my private elevator. It's safer.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT
text: shooting DOWN on the car as it rises. The shaft above it is
text: filled with BIRDS -- starlings, crows, pigeons and the like,
text: swooping and gliding among the gears and cables...
scene_heading: EXT. ROOF OF GLOBE BUILDING - THAT MOMENT
text: In BG, the helicopter on its pad, idling noisily, the rotors
text: still spinning. In FG, the small dormer-like structure that
text: houses the STAIRWAY. The metal access door opens, and the
text: first of the GUARDS steps warily out, rifle at the ready. He
text: smiles back at his pal.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: No way. They don't pay us enough to
dialog: tangle with Batm--
text: A black-gloved, CHROME-TALONED HAND snakes around the edge of
text: the dormer and RAKES ACROSS HIS THROAT...
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT
text: SWEAT beads up on PROVOST's lip as the GUARD hits the up
text: button and the car begins to rise. Suddenly, the LIGHTS GO
text: OUT. The car stops with a lurch.
speaker_heading: PROVOST
dialog: What is it?? What's happening??
text: Suddenly, there in the darkness, they hear a series of loud
text: POPPING SOUNDS...which could be gunfire...
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - ON CROWD
text: singing "Here Comes Santa Claus" at the top of their lungs.
text: Happy faces beam. No one hears anything unusual over the
dialog: music...
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - ACROSS STREET - ON BATMAN
text: BATMAN straining to listen. We get another faint series of
text: POPS -- barely audible over the CAROLING from below, and the
text: loud PUTT-PUTT-PUTT of the helicopter blades.
text: He can't really be sure he's heard anything at all. He scans
text: the roof of the Globe building, but he can't see what's
text: happening beyond the big steel globe sculpture and the neon
dialog: sign...
scene_heading: EXT. GLOBE BUILDING - ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT
text: The CATWOMAN lets fly with another burst of automatic fire
text: from the dead GUARD's rifle. The helicopter is still idling,
text: but no one's left to fly it -- the rooftop is littered with
dialog: stiffs...
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT
text: PITCH BLACK. Pre-verbal GROANS and MURMURINGS OF FEAR issue
text: from the darkness. An EERIE RED LIGHT kicks on -- the
text: emergency generators -- and we see PROVOST backed up in a
text: corner of the car, twitching and jumping like a crazed
text: spastic. The GUARD, in a futile effort to placate him, points
text: up at the LIGHT:
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: There. Mr. Provost. See? The
dialog: generator's kicked in. It's just an
dialog: electrical problem.
text: PROVOST is only marginally consoled. They hear a strange
text: TWITTERING NOISE in the shaft above them...
text: PROVOST starts babbling again. The GUARD slaps him across the
text: face. But the TWITTERING has him a bit concerned as well. He
text: stares up at the ceiling of the car as he PUNCHES BUTTONS on
text: the panel; with another LURCH, the car begins to move.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: There. See? It's moving. We're fine.
speaker_heading: PROVOST
dialog: It's going down. We're going DOWN!!!
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT
text: The BIRDS in the shaft have all ROOSTED on the TOP OF THE CAR.
text: They're patiently riding it down as it descends...
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT
text: The car stops again. PROVOST is totally losing it. The
text: exasperated GUARD grabs him and SHAKES HIM.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Okay, Mr. Provost -- I'm gonna have a look
dialog: through the trap door. But I need you to
dialog: help me. Okay? You have to help.
text: PROVOST nods and tries to get a grip on himself. The GUARD
text: looks up at the trap door in the ceiling of the car. He can't
dialog: reach it...
text: He uncuffs the BOX containing PROVOST'S RAVEN from his wrist
text: -- and STANDS on it. Still short. Unholstering his gun and
text: using it as a prod, he can almost reach the trap door. He
text: JUMPS UP and, poking with the gun, manages to dislodge the
text: panel slightly.
text: More TWITTERING. PROVOST and the guard look up through the
text: tiny crack in the ceiling and see nothing but darkness.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Probably just some bird that's gotten in
dialog: the shaft. Now calm down. You'll have to
dialog: give me a boost.
text: The GUARD climbs back atop the raven box. PROVOST gives him a
text: boost and he manages to catch hold of the lip of the trap
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: GUARD (cont.)
dialog: Okay, help me out...steady...
text: PROVOST wraps both arms around the GUARD's wriggling LEGS and
text: tries to hoist him upward.
scene_heading: INT. SHAFT - ON ROOF OF CAR - THAT MOMENT
text: From a vantage level with the roof of the car, we see the
text: GUARD'S FINGERS, clinging to the lip of the trap door. Now
text: his HEAD rises into view, pushing the panel aside as he pulls
text: himself upward.
text: He peers around. His BROW wrinkles as he sees a bizarre sight
text: -- PASSELS of SQUAWKING BIRDS, walking back and forth in front
text: of him, STRUTTING and PREENING mere inches from his face...
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT
text: The bottom half of the GUARD dangles from the ceiling.
text: PROVOST still has his arms wrapped around the GUARD's knees.
text: All at once, the GUARD begins to SCREAM -- his body JERKS and
text: his legs KICK WILDLY. Still PROVOST struggles to hang on --
text: even as BLOOD spatters across the top of his bald dome...
text: Finally, the GUARD's violent spasms are too much. PROVOST
text: trips over the raven box, stumbles backward and lands on his
text: ass in a corner of the car. The GUARD tumbles in a heap to
text: the elevator floor, his face PECKED and CLAWED beyond
text: recognition, his eyes gone altogether.
text: PROVOST lets out a series of SHRIEKS. He peers at the open
text: trap door, sees the BIRDS staring curiously down at him, and
text: SHRIEKS AGAIN.
text: The EMERGENCY TELEPHONE rings. He stares at it. It rings
text: again. Shielding his eyes and screwing up his courage,
text: PROVOST crawls across the floor and reaches for the receiver.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN (V.O.; filter)
text: Sixteenth floor. Linens, housewares,
dialog: ladies' lingerie!
speaker_heading: PROVOST
dialog: W-who is this??
scene_heading: INT. GLOBE - BASEMENT LOADING BAY - THAT MOMENT
text: NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VANS are parked in neat rows -- all
text: driverless. FRICK is sitting with a boxful of electrical
text: equipment next to a bank of ELEVATORS; all the cars have been
text: LOCKED OPEN here in the basement, except for ONE -- PROVOST's
text: private elevator, the doors to which are still closed. The
text: PENGUIN stands beside it, speaking into a RED PHONE.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Mr. Provost? If you want to get out of
dialog: that car alive, I suggest you follow my
dialog: instructions to the letter.
text: As he talks, we see various NEWSPAPER EMPLOYEES sprawled on
text: the concrete nearby, DEAD. A CORRUGATED METAL DOOR has been
text: lowered over the LOADING BAY, separating the newspaper
text: production staff from the VAN POOL. They're trapped on the
text: other side. BANGING AWAY LOUDLY on the door...
speaker_heading: PENGUIN (cont.)
text: SHUT UP IN THERE.
dialog: <i>(calmly; into phone)</i>
dialog: You should see a cord hanging just behind
dialog: you.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT
text: PROVOST looks over his shoulder and sees the aforementioned
text: CORD descending through the trap door.
speaker_heading: PROVOST
dialog: Yes -- yes, I see it --
speaker_heading: PENGUIN (V.O; filter)
dialog: Tie the cord to the handle of your box.
text: PROVOST lets the phone drop. He grits his teeth, but hastens
text: to obey. As he's knotting the cord around the handle of the
text: box, a DINKY BIRD flutters down through the trap and sends him
text: into a panic. Practically weeping, he reaches for the phone.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN (V.O.; filter)
dialog: When you're done, I want you to give two
text: sharp yanks on the cord.
text: Cowering in terror, PROVOST reaches for the cord and yanks it
dialog: twice.
speaker_heading: PROVOST
dialog: Who are you?? Why are you doing this??
scene_heading: INT. LOADING BAY - ON PENGUIN
text: Behind him, FRICK and FRACK are pulling on RED BERETS and
scene_heading: BATMAN SWEATSHIRTS -- Order of the Bat gear. FRICK climbs
text: into a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN and starts the engine.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Well, Mr. Provost, I guess you could call
dialog: me an irate reader. And to be perfectly
dialog: frank -- I'm doing this because I hate
dialog: Garfield.
text: Chuckling, the PENGUIN holds a SONIC DEVICE up to the
text: mouthpiece of the phone.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT
text: A SHRILL WHINE emanates from the receiver. All at once, the
text: elevator car is FULL OF BIRDS -- squawking wildly, flinging
text: themselves against the wall, going insane in the tiny confined
dialog: space.
text: PROVOST is screaming like a madman. The birds are in his
text: hair, his face -- everywhere. He fights his way over to the
text: panel and begins punching buttons in a frenzy...
text: All at once the car PLUNGES DOWNWARD. It's as if the floor
text: has DROPS AWAY beneath PROVOST's feet -- he's in FREE-FALL.
scene_heading: INT. LOADING BAY - ON PENGUIN
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Going down!
text: He hangs up the phone and steps a discreet distance back from
text: the ELEVATOR DOORS.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT
text: The RAVEN BOX dangles from its cord in FG as the CAR rockets
text: uncontrollably downward. A steady stream ot BIRDS are making
text: a quick exit from the trap door in the roof...
scene_heading: INT. TOP-FLOOR LANDING - THAT MOMENT
text: The CATWOMAN's on a landing near the stairwell, just below the
text: dormer that leads to the roof. She pries open a pair of
scene_heading: ELEVATOR DOORS...
text: ...and a FLOCK of BIRDS pours out of the empty shaft, making
text: for the open ACCESS DOOR a half-story above. She reaches
text: inside, finds the cord attached to the RAVEN BOX, and reels it
dialog: in.
text: She rips off the lock and opens the box for a quick look at
text: her trophy. It's there, all right -- another RAVEN just like
text: the first two. An awful CRASH, from twenty-five stories down,
text: RATTLES THE SHAFT...
text: She makes a disgusted face, grabs the RAVEN, and bolts for the
dialog: roof.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP ACROSS STREET - ON BATMAN
text: He watches in puzzlement as a VAST FLOCK OF BIRDS takes flight
text: from the Globe roof across the square. Something weird is
text: definitely going on. He's about to abandon his post --
text: -- but down below, the CAROLERS have stopped CAROLING. The
text: big tree's about to be lit, and they're counting off the
dialog: seconds:
speaker_heading: CROWD
dialog: Ten! Nine!...
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - CORNER NEWSTAND
text: A ramshackle kiosk at street level. The NEWS VENDOR has
text: stepped out onto the sidewalk to watch the tree festivities.
text: A GLOBE DELIVERY VAN, its side bearing the "BATMAN -- HERO OR
text: MENACE?" advertisement, cruises past and dumps a bundle of
text: papers on the curb.
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON CROWD AT TREE
text: EXCITEMENT is BUILDING as the seconds tick off:
speaker_heading: CROWD
dialog: ...Three! Two! One!
text: The CHRISTMAS LIGHTS come on, and the CROWD breaks into
text: CHEERS. The ORCHESTRA strikes up a sprightly version of
text: "JINGLE BELLS."
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON NEWSTAND
text: The NEWS VENDOR is applauding and singing along like everyone
text: else when a second newspaper van rumbles past...
speaker_heading: NEWS VENDOR
dialog: Hey! No! I aleady got a --
text: He spots TWO MASKED MEN in the doorway of the van -- wearing
text: RED BERETS and BAT-SHIRTS. They shove a BODY out the door --
text: The mutilated corpse of HARRISON PROVOST lands on the sidewalk
text: with a THUD -- right beside a bundle of NEWSPAPERS which read
scene_heading: "BATMAN MURDER SPREE BAFFLES POLICE."
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON VAN - MOVING
text: The NEWS VENDOR chases after the VAN, but it's already rounded
text: a corner and is cruising along the periphery of Gotham Square.
text: The CROWD is still singing merrily, unaware of its presence --
text: -- until the BACK DOORS fly open -- and a swarm of RABID,
text: CHITTERING BATS screech out into the midst of the crowd!!
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON CROWD AT TREE
text: The CAROLERS break into MASS HYSTERIA as HIDEOUS BATS swoop
text: down from above, CLAWING at their heads and shoulders.
text: ORCHESTRA MEMBERS drop their instruments and stagger off the
text: BAND PLATFORM, falling into the branches of the giant
dialog: Christmas tree.
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON SIDEWALKS
text: CHRISTMAS SHOPPERS are teeming in and out of nearby STORES.
text: They drop their SHOPPING BAGS and race about in utter CHAOS as
scene_heading: the bats attack. WOMEN SCREAM. CHILDREN SCREAM. MEN SCREAM
speaker_heading: TOO.
text: A MAN staggers backward through a GLASS STOREFRONT and lands
text: on his butt in a WINDOW DISPLAY -- a big mechanical SANTA
text: CLAUS on his North-Pole throne, chuckling merrily in a
text: prerecorded voice: "HO HO HO." The MAN STRUGGLES WILDLY as
text: the BATS converge on him.
scene_heading: INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - THAT MOMENT
text: HORRIFIED SHOPPERS scatter through the aisles as the BATS pour
text: in through the broken window. WOMEN lined up for a FREE
text: MAKEOVER squeal in panic as BATS arrive to rearrange their
dialog: hairdos.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN
text: He stares down stunned at the PANDEMONIUM raging below. He
text: glances across the street...and sees the TINY SILHOUETTE of a
text: WOMAN standing atop the cast-iron GLOBE SCULPTURE, LAUGHING at
text: the chaos, TAUNTING him.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS - OVERHEAD ANGLE - THAT MOMENT
text: A few blocks away from Gotham Square. SIRENS HOWL. There's a
text: steady stream of COP CARS speeding toward the site of the
text: disturbance. One vehicle is moving in the opposite direction,
text: against traffic -- a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN.
scene_heading: EXT. GLOBE BUILDING - ROOFTOP - A MOMENT LATER
text: BATMAN touches down on the roof and stares in horror at the
text: CORPSES strewn across the helipad. A dying GUARD raises a
dialog: shaky hand...
text: BATMAN crouches beside him. A GURGLE comes up from his throat
text: and a bubble of BLOOD swells on his lips. All at once he
text: hears a WOMAN'S VOICE from the shadows of the GLOBE
text: SCULPTURE...
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Some people just can't take discipline.
dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: Go ahead. Finish 'em off...
text: His head jerks up. He can't see anything. A sudden WHOOSHING
text: noise, and now the voice is coming from the other side of the
dialog: roof.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN (O.S.)
dialog: You might as well. You're going to get
dialog: blamed for it anyway.
text: He stands. He gets a quick glimpse of a FELINE SHADOW
text: springing past a skylight; she's jumping all around the roof,
text: clinging to exposed pipes and fixtures. He reaches for a
dialog: Batarang.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Oh, come on, angel. You know you want to.
dialog: <i>(purring loudly)</i>
dialog: Besides -- I want to see how you do it!
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Who are you?
text: He's barely gotten it out when she SLAMS INTO HIM from behind,
text: feet first, knocking him to the rooftop. He tries to get up,
text: but she comes at him with a couple of CARTWHEELING KICKS,
text: knocking him back into a cornice. He ducks right just as a
text: SHARP SPIKED HEEL strikes the exposed brick a mere three
text: inches from his throat.
text: He catches her leg, upends her -- but she somersaults away and
dialog: lands on her feet. Cats always do...
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: My, aren't we frisky tonight.
text: He flings the BATARANG. It CLANGS into the big NEON SIGN as
text: she SPRINGS up into the darkness, out of reach. GLASS TUBING
text: shatters and SPARKS FLY as she calls down from the shadows --
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: I should tell you -- I've got nine lives
dialog: to play with -- and you've only got one...
text: He turns -- she drops DIRECTLY ONTO HIM -- and locked in a
text: death grip, they STAGGER BACKWARDS across the roof, directly
text: toward the HELICOPTER. The huge ROTOR BLADES are still
dialog: turning...
text: BATMAN ducks instinctively and the CATWOMAN breaks free --
text: FALLING BACKWARD onto the roof. It's a strategic move: when
text: he rushes at her, she BRACES HERSELF against the ground and
text: KICKS UPWARD with startling force.
text: This time the spiked heel connects -- LIFTING BATMAN off his
text: feet, KNOCKING HIM BACKWARD into the TAIL of the HELICOPTER.
text: He slumps there, stunned -- and before he knows it, she's on
dialog: him.
text: She grabs his THROAT with one hand and clamps the other around
text: his CROTCH. He tries to break her grip, but she's just as
text: strong as he is. And she's LIFTING him -- forcing him upward,
text: toward the REAR STABILIZING ROTOR on the tail of the
dialog: helicopter!
text: The rear ROTOR BLADES WHINE LIKE A BUZZSAW as his head rises
text: perilously closer. At the last possible instant, he grabs a
text: handful of her HAIR -- YANKS IT as hard as he can --
text: With a YOWL, she releases him. They tumble to the roof and
text: she DIVES ATOP HIM. Her TALONS click into place -- he sees
text: them poised directly above his EYES --
text: -- but manages to slam an ELBOW under her chin before she can
text: strike. Now they're disentangled; they get up groggily and
dialog: circle each other...
text: SOMEONE IS BANGING on the metal door that leads up to the
text: roof, trying to break it down. BATMAN turns for an instant --
dialog: a sudden CRACK --
text: -- and he finds himself all wrapped up in the CATWOMAN's CAT-
text: O'-NINE-TAILS...which is also outfitted with a TASER. She
text: sends a PARALYZING ELECTRIC CHARGE through his body and he
text: collapses to the roof in a jittering heap. The BANGING on the
text: door is louder...
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Did I tell you I invited company? -- Keep
dialog: 'em busy, angel, I've gotta scat.
text: She kneels down and plants a BIG WET KISS on his twitching
text: face. Then she scurries to the edge of the roof,
scene_heading: DISAPPEARING --
text: -- just as the DOOR gives way -- and an ARMED SWAT TEAM comes
text: crashing out onto the roof!
text: Just coming around, BATMAN tries to roll out of sight -- but
text: the COPS are swarming the place. They spot the BODIES on the
text: tar and gravel, see BATMAN scuttling for cover, and draw the
text: obvious conclusion. Pulling guns, they OPEN FIRE. BULLETS
text: RICOCHET off the big metal GLOBE.
text: BATMAN, as is customary in these situations, shoots a
text: GRAPPLING HOOK at the roof of the next building over -- which
text: is a couple of stories taller than the Globe -- and REELS
text: HIMSELF UPWARD along the side wall. The SWAT COPS score a
text: couple of dead hits which set him swinging like a pendulum,
text: but his body armor holds and he clings to the line long enough
text: to reach the roof.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. NEWSPAPER VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: FRlCK and FRACK, still in their Order-of-the-Bat garb, are in
text: the front seats; the PENGUIN is leaning out the side door.
dialog: Someone's obviously tipped the COPS about the source of all
dialog: the ruckus --
text: -- because a pair of POLICE CARS are on their tail and gaining
text: fast. Still hanging in the doorway, the PENGUIN raises his
text: UMBRELLA, peers down its length like a RIFLE SIGHT, and PULLS
speaker_heading: A TRIGGER.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT
text: A SONIC DART -- one of the PENGUIN'S BIRD MAGNETS -- lodges
text: itself in the GRILLE of the foremost POLICE CAR.
scene_heading: INT. SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT
text: The COPS in the car react in astonishment as PIGEONS begin
text: HURLING THEMSELVES at the WINDSHIELDS. A DOZEN KAMIKAZE BIRDS
text: bounce off in rapid succession. CRACKS begin to spread across
dialog: the glass.
text: The COPS can't see where they're driving. The car SWERVES
text: WILDLY. And still the PIGEONS KEEP COMING -- COVERING THE
text: WINDSHIELD -- TOTALLY OBSCURING THE STREETS FROM VIEW...
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS - ON SQUAD CARS - THAT MOMENT
text: The first car, COMPLETELY COVERED WITH BIRDS, smacks into a
text: LAMPPOST and SKIDS. The second car CRASHES INTO IT. And the
text: pigeons continue to pour down from the heavens, SWARMING onto
text: the immobilized squad cars.
scene_heading: INT. NEWSPAPER VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT
text: The PENGUIN grins with delight as the van speeds off

speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Look at that, boys -- they do flock
dialog: together!!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: AMBULANCES are pouring into the square as the BAT ATTACK
text: continues. COPS are firing their guns blindly into the skies
text: as they try to evacuate the citizenry. PARAMEDICS drop the
text: stretcher they're carrying when BATS swoop down at their
dialog: heads...
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT
text: BATMAN is still pursuing the CATWOMAN, who's perched one roof
text: over, in a squat, wiggling a finger for him to follow. The
text: roofs are icy and treacherous, but he matches her step for
text: step, leap for leap, as she vaults from one building to the
text: next, leading him on. Finally she reaches the edge of a
text: building on the corner of the block; there's no place to go
text: but down. She squats on the ledge and smiles, beckoning to
dialog: him --
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Ooh. Where have you been all my life?
text: He edges closer. Suddenly, she does a BACKFLIP -- DIRECTLY
text: OFF THE EDGE OF THE ROOF.
text: BATMAN hears GLASS SHATTERING. He hesitates a second -- moves
text: closer to the edge of the roof -- PEERS OVER THE ICY CORNICE.
scene_heading: BATMAN'S POV - THAT MOMENT
text: Staring down, he sees a narrow LEDGE running around the facade
text: of the building some ten or twelve feet below. The window of
text: a corner apartment has been smashed; the curtains are flapping
text: in the chill wind.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOF - ON BATMAN - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
text: She's obviously making her getaway through the apartment.
text: BATMAN climbs up on the slippery cornice and prepares to drop
text: to the ledge below -- cautiously, because it's a long way
text: down. A sudden CRACK --
text: The CATWOMAN hasn't entered the apartment. Instead, she's
text: followed the ledge around the corner of the building, silently
text: doubling back onto the roof behind BATMAN. He TURNS just as
text: her WHIP wraps itself around his left leg. She gives it a
text: sharp tug -- his feet SKID on the ice -- and HE TOPPLES OVER
text: THE EDGE OF THE ROOF.
scene_heading: EXT. FACADE OF BUILDING - ON BATMAN
text: He plunges downward for the briefest of seconds -- then JERKS
text: UP SHORT, SLAMMING INTO THE WALL OF THE BUILDING. The WHIP
text: has coiled itself around his leg, and for now it's holding
text: tight. He's dangling upside down, bat-like; he bounces away
text: from the wall; he SPINS in midair as one loop of the whip
text: UNRAVELS, dropping him another foot or so.
text: He manages to brace his left foot against the wall. It's a
text: massive strain, but he's momentarily safe if he can keep from
text: moving. The alternative is a twelve-story drop, straight down
dialog: to the pavement...
scene_heading: EXT. ROOF - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT
text: She's wrapped the handle-end of the whip around an exposed
text: pipe on the roof, anchoring BATMAN in place. With a cheshire-
text: cat grin, she removes the RAVEN from her knapsack and holds it
text: on the edge of the cornice.
scene_heading: EXT. FACADE - THAT MOMENT
text: BATMAN hanging immobile. Craning his neck, he can just see
dialog: the
text: RAVEN STATUETTE on the ledge above him -- bouncing slightly,
text: and apparently talking to him...
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Nevermore. Nevermore!
text: Now the CATWOMAN appears beside it -- elbows on the cornice,
text: chin propped up on her folded hands, like a chatty girl at a
dialog: fern bar.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Cute, huh! I think it'll look nice over
dialog: the fireplace. Maybe you can drop by and
dialog: see it sometime.
dialog: <i>(demurely)</i>
dialog: I hope you won't think I'm too...
dialog: aggressive or anything, but I find you
dialog: very attractive.
text: She toys aimlessly with the whipcord, batting at it like a cat
text: with a piece of yarn. BATMAN grimaces. She speaks in a low,
text: soothing, seductive tone -- almost a purr. Behind the bondage
text: mask she bats her eyelashes.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN (cont.)
dialog: It's just so hard to meet interesting men
dialog: these days. Don't you think so?
dialog: <i>(sighing)</i>
dialog: I have trouble with relationships. Men
dialog: find me intimidating...kind of predatory,
dialog: you know? Really I'm not. Really I'm
dialog: just playful...
text: BATMAN huffs and puffs, trying to bend at the waist so he can
text: grab hold of the whip. She frowns and YANKS on it. His foot
text: flies free of the wall, and another loop of the whip uncoils
text: before he can stabilize himself.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN (cont.)
dialog: Don't laugh! I'm trying to open up to
dialog: you!
text: Angrily, she holds a STEEL CLAW to the whip -- ready to cut
dialog: him loose.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON BATMAN
text: He's palmed the GRAPPLING-HOOK LAUNCHER from his belt.
text: Holding it close to his body, out of view, he works it around
text: into firing position. He'll shoot it right through her if he
dialog: has to...
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN (cont.)
dialog: I always seem to fall for the wrong guys.
dialog: You know...most men are rats.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON CATWOMAN
text: She withdraws her hand from the whip, reverts to her
dialog: philosphical mode.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Mice, really. It's disgusting -- they beg
dialog: you to walk all over them and then they
dialog: whine when you do it. Once you've had
dialog: your fun there's not much you can do but
dialog: kill them.
dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: But you seem different. I mean, you
dialog: obviously understand about dressing up...
dialog: that saves a lot of explaining. I think
dialog: people should indulge their fantasies,
dialog: don't you?
text: BATMAN is sweating profusely. He can't hold his position much
text: longer. And the CATWOMAN is dragging this insane flirtation
text: out endlessly...
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: So I think I'll let you live. Cute boys
dialog: like you are hard to find...
dialog: <i>(standing up)</i>
dialog: 'Bye, angel. I'll be thinking about you.
text: And just like that, she VANISHES -- moving silently off with
text: her raven, leaving BATMAN to dangle. He hangs there a moment,
text: tries to twist himself around without moving his foot. He
text: braces one hand against the wall; with the other, he lifts his
text: grappling gun and FIRES.
text: The HOOK SNAGS somewhere on the roof. BATMAN yanks the line
text: taut and is laboriously trying to pull himself erect when --
text: -- the CATWOMAN reappears over the edge of the cornice!
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Gee...I'm so fickle.
text: A QUICK SWIPE of her STEEL TALONS, and the whipcord is neatly
text: SEVERED. BATMAN'S FOOT slips out from under him -- but he's
text: still got hold of the GRAPPLING GUN. He DROPS eight or ten
dialog: feet...
scene_heading: EXT. ROOF - ON CATWOMAN
text: watching with amusement as BATMAN's weight causes the hook to
text: DISLODGE. It skitters across the gravel surface of the roof
text: and CATCHES, at the last instant, on the edge of the
speaker_heading: CORNICE --
text: -- which promptly CRUMBLES and GIVES WAY. Fascinated, the
text: CATWOMAN leans over the edge of the roof and peers down...
scene_heading: ANGLE ON BATMAN - AS HE FALLS
text: He flails wildly, tangled in his cape, as the ground rushes up
text: toward him. He gets a last-ditch inspiration -- finds the GAS
text: CYLINDER on his belt and hits the switch. The rods in his
text: cape begin to INFLATE...
text: Six stories up, his BATWINGS spring erect, slowing his plunge.
text: Five stories up, an UPDRAFT hits him and he suddenly INVERTS.
text: Four stories up, he rights himself. Three stories up, he goes
text: into a downward spiral, out of control, gliding in great wide
text: arcs over the street...
text: ...and a moment later there are no stories left. With an ugly
text: crunch, he smacks into the slush-covered pavement and BOUNCES.
text: Face down, he skids some twenty feet to a halt -- right in the
text: middle of a BUSY INTERSECTION.
scene_heading: EXT. INTERSECTION - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: A DELIVERY TRUCK hits the brakes and screeches to a stop, two
text: feet away from BATMAN'S HEAD. He doesn't move. PEDESTRIANS
text: are already gawking and pointing as the DRIVER climbs out and
text: peers down at the inert caped figure lying face-down in the
dialog: street:
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: What the hell is this?
text: CARS are backed up, due to the panic in Gotham Square a few
text: blocks over. HORNS are honking. A TRAFFIC COP marches
dialog: over --
speaker_heading: TRAFFIC COP
dialog: Awright, what's the problem here?
dialog: <i>(spotting BATMAN)</i>
dialog: Jesus.
text: He tries to clear the crowd away. A full-fledged GRIDLOCK is
text: forming around the prostrate BATMAN. The COP blows his
text: whistle, tries to maintain order as two unifonned PATROLMEN
text: rush up to join him.
text: They manage to roll the unconscious BATMAN over on his back.
text: The assembled COPS stare down at the mask, the scuffed body
text: armor. Still waxy, they finger the GUNS in their holsters...
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: Good God. Cowan -- get to the car --
dialog: radio the commissioner!!
text: By now there must be two hundred people in the intersection,
text: all surging forward to get a look. More COPS are arriving to
dialog: beat them back.
speaker_heading: TRAFFIC COP
dialog: Is he dead? What do we do?
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: The mask. Get the mask off.
text: They hunker down over BATMAN. One of them tugs at his mask --
text: but the helmet-like cowl doesn't want to give way. He feels
dialog: around --
speaker_heading: TRAFFIC COP
dialog: Some kinda seam here on the neck...
text: The PATROLMAN nods okay, and the COP tugs at a Velcro-like
text: fastening under BATMAN's chin. The instant it comes open --
text: -- a BURST of FINE GREEN MIST spews forth from concealed JETS
text: in the gold-and-black BAT-EMBLEM, and the COPS reel backward,
text: shrieking, gasping for breath and clewing at their eyes.
dialog: Booby-trap -- they've just been Maced.
text: One of the ONLOOKING COPS steps back in horror and confusion.
text: On impulse, he draws his gun and FIRES TWICE at BATMAN. The
text: body JERKS and the bullets RICOCHET OFF --
speaker_heading: TRAFFIC COP
dialog: DON'T SHOOT, you idiot. The crowd --
text: Before he can finish, a BLACK BOOT kicks the gun out of the
text: ONLOOKING COP's hand. BATMAN is back among the living.
text: SIRENS BLARE as he spins and rolls into a crouch -- lashing
text: out with elbows and knees -- driving the cops back --
text: Fuck the crowd. TWO MORE COPS pull their guns and open fire
text: in absolute panic. BATMAN slams backward into the delivery
text: truck and crumples to the ground. As he falls, he grabs a
text: couple of SMOKE CAPSULES from his belt and flings them to the
dialog: pavement.
text: Seconds later, a THICK CLOUD OF BLACK SMOKE is spreading
text: through the intersection. BATMAN emerges into the midst of
text: the crowd -- weaving in and out among the stalled vehicles --
scene_heading: EXT. INTERSECTION - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT
text: A MOUNTED COP rides up to the outer fringe of the traffic jam,
text: drawn by all the confusion. He rears the horse back, turns it
text: in a circle; blows his piercing whistle as he tries to reroute
dialog: the incoming cars...
text: Suddenly a WIRE wraps itself around his chest and arms. He
text: looks down. He sees a BATARANG in the instant before a sudden
text: JERK pulls him cleanly off his mount.
text: BATMAN climbs up on the hood of the nearest car -- vaults over
text: to the next -- and the next -- then hops into the saddle of
text: the MOUNTED COP's waiting HORSE. He digs in his heels,
text: maneuvering through traffic...
scene_heading: EXT. POLICE CAR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
text: LT. EDDIE BULLOCK and another plainclothesman are a few blocks
text: off trying to get through the jam. Their siren is on, but the
text: cars blocking their path have no room to pull over. BULLOCK
text: grabs the radio mike:
speaker_heading: BULLOCK
dialog: Hell of a mess up here, Commissioner.
dialog: We'll have to go in on foot...
text: As they wait for a response, they see a HORSE charging past in
text: the opposite direction. On the back of the horse...is BATMAN.
text: Gaping, BULLOCK nudges his partner -- who throws the car
text: immediately into REVERSE. As they watch, BATMAN kicks the
text: horse's flanks and turns right -- toward Gotham Park.
scene_heading: INT. GOTHAM PARK - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
text: Two RED BERETS, members of the Order of the Bat, are on night
text: patrol, strolling down a rambling path near the entrance to
dialog: the park.
speaker_heading: RED BERET I
dialog: This is wack, man. Nothing ever happens
dialog: around here anymore.
text: The other RED BERET lets out a WHOOP OF FEAR and yanks his
text: partner out of the way. They tumble into a snowdrift as
text: BATMAN'S HORSE vaults over the stone wall of the park and
text: gallops past, nearly trampling them in the process. By now,
text: SQUAD CARS are roaring into the park...
scene_heading: INT. PARK - ANOTHER SECTION - A MOMENT LATER
text: SIRENS BLARE and RED LIGHTS FLASH in the distance as the COP
text: CARS spread out along the winding roads that run through the
text: park. BATMAN reins the horse in suddenly as a black-and-white
text: whips past on an access road just ahead of him, no more than
text: twenty yards away.
text: He turns the horse in a circle. MORE RED LIGHTS appear in the
text: distance; another contingent of SQUAD CARS has just entered
dialog: from the opposite side of the park. It's going to be tough
dialog: getting out of here...
text: Then: his eyes fall on the statue of his great-grandfather,
text: GENERAL WAYNE -- two Waynes on horseback, not twenty feet
text: apart. He thinks back to his earlier conversation with VICKI
dialog: and gets an inspiration.
text: He rides past General Wayne to the STONE BRIDGE which spans
text: the little frozen creek. There he finds the DRAINAGE TUNNEL
text: VICKI described, obscured by the wire-mesh grate. This must
dialog: be where the boy vigilante holes up...
text: He dismounts, ties his CAPE to the pommel of the horse's
text: saddle and sends it off with a slap. He pries the grate loose
text: and crawls inside.
scene_heading: INT. DRAINAGE TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT
text: A dank, but cozy, hideout; WARM STEAM hisses from a grate in
dialog: the floor.
text: RUMBLING SOUNDS fill the little chamber as a SUBWAY TRAIN
text: passes directly underneath. A little farther back there's an
text: ACCESS SHAFT, with a Jacob's ladder, leading to the train
dialog: tracks below.
text: Poking around, he finds a couple of cardboard BOXES -- the boy
text: vigilante's stash. The first contains tins of food, plus
text: various odds and ends. The second's more in line with what he
text: needs -- it's full of OLD CLOTHING.
text: A TRAIN rumbles past underneath. BRUCE removes his COWL and
dialog: sets about putting together a civilian disguise that'll get
text: him out of the park. A wool hat and a long, moth-eaten
text: topcoat: perfect. As he's pulling them out of the box, he
dialog: spies something extremely odd --
text: It's a COSTUME -- a spangled red-and-green GYMNASTS OUTFIT
text: with a little yellow CAPE -- neatly folded and in pristine
text: condition. He removes it carefully from the box and holds it
text: up in front of him. Stitched on the vest is a single initial,
text: "R," in a black circle. He stares at the whole mystifying
text: ensemble in complete befuddlement...
text: The roar of the train subsides, and he hears a SCUFFLING
text: NOISE. Someone's in the tunnel with him. He lowers the
dialog: costume abruptly --
text: -- revealing DICK, the boy vigilante, who's crouched in front
text: of him not three feet away. The kid's just crawled up through
text: the ACCESS SHAFT, and he's not at all happy to see an intruder
dialog: messing with his stuff:
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: It's MINE!
text: He lunges furiously at BRUCE. The two of them tumble back
text: into the grate at the tunnel entrance, KNOCKING IT LOOSE --
scene_heading: EXT. PARK - MOUTH OF TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: A POLICE CAR streaks past on the bridge overhead mere seconds
text: before BRUCE and DICK roll out into the snow, still grappling.
text: BRUCE flings the kid into the bridge abutment. DICK lands
text: hard; when he looks up, his EYES WIDEN, and a weird crooked
text: smile comes to his face...
text: Out here in the moonlight he can see his opponent. The body
text: armor -- the gold-and-black emblem on the breastplate -- and
text: above it all, the face of BRUCE WAYNE, exposed to view...
text: As a siren howls nearby, BRUCE flattens himself against the
text: bridge. Like it or not, his fate rests entirely in a strange
text: little boy's hands.
text: The kid sizes up the situation immediately. He nods his head
text: up and down. Then he takes off his own ratty coat and throws
text: it to BRUCE.
text: BRUCE is in no position to look a gift horse in the mouth. He
text: pulls on the coat, gives DICK a nod of acknowledgement, and
text: starts to move off.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: NO. WAIT!
text: BRUCE turns, uncertainly. DICK throws him his woolen SKI CAP.
text: The KID GIGGLES -- oddly, uncontrollably. Then he sprints off
text: into the woods, dancing, leaping. As he disappears from view,
text: he lets out a shrill, piercing, almost FERAL SHRIEK --
text: -- which is obviously intended to divert the cops. BRUCE
text: makes haste in the opposite direction.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK - ANOTHER SECTION - A MOMENT LATER
text: BRUCE'S HORSE gallops through the trees, the black bat-cape
text: still attached to its saddle and BILLOWING behind it.
scene_heading: INT. SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: TWO COPS scanning the park. The CAPED HORSE charges past in
text: front of them and is momentarily silhouetted in the
text: headlights. From a distance, it looks like BATMAN is still in
dialog: the saddle.
text: The COP at the wheel makes a sudden turn. A moment later, he
text: SLAMS ON THE BRAKES.
text: A MAN has just stepped out onto the road, directly in the
text: squad car's path -- a hunched figure in an old coat and woolen
text: ski cap, obviously one of the homeless. A COP leans on the
text: horn and shouts out the window:
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Dumb son of a bitch!!
text: The MAN -- BRUCE -- steps back out of the squad car's path.
text: The COPS take off -- in hot pursuit of a riderless horse.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - PRE-DAWN
text: A DOCTOR'S BAG rests on the kitchen table. ALFRED, in robe
text: and slippers, rummages inside it and comes up with an ACE
speaker_heading: BANDAGE.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Commissioner Gordon called. He wants to
text: install a full contingent of police guards
text: here at the manor -- in round-the-clock
dialog: shifts -- to protect you from Batman.
text: BRUCE is sitting erect in a straightbacked chair. His shirt
text: is open and he's holding his arms aloft while ALFRED wraps a
text: full roll of adhesive tape around his battered RIBS.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Great. What'd you tell him?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I told him that since you were Batman,
dialog: you'd require no protection from Batman.
text: BRUCE makes a face: how droll. ALFRED tears off the tape with
text: a brisk YANK -- and BRUCE lets out an involuntary YELP OF
speaker_heading: PAIN.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Jesus, Alfred -- !!
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: In future, sir...I strongly advise against
text: trying to fly off twenty-story buildings.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
text: It's just a few bruises.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: One bruise, sir. Which covers your entire
dialog: body.
text: BRUCE gets up -- stiffly -- and buttons his shirt in gingerly
text: fashion while ALFRED packs his first-aid gear in the doctor's
dialog: bag.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I'm getting too old for this line of work.
dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: Cops placed me at the scene of the crime
dialog: -- that weird kid of Vicki's saw my
dialog: face --
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I shouldn't worry overmuch. I doubt the
dialog: two of you move in the same circles.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: -- and I got the living shit knocked out
dialog: of me by a woman.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Sir -- such outmoded sexist attitudes are
text: quite unbecoming.
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - DAY
text: In a lavishly-appointed guest room on Gotham's Upper East Side
text: (or equivalent thereof), we find a pair of PLAINCLOTHES COPS
text: settled in for a stakeout: rumpled topcoats thrown across
text: antique chairs, french-fry bags and GREASY BURGER WRAPPINGS
text: littering the carpet. HIGH-POWERED RIFLES propped against one
dialog: wall.
text: They peer through venetian blinds at an ELEGANT OLD BROWNSTONE
text: across the street...
scene_heading: HIS POV - ROOF OF BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT
text: A UNIFORMED COP, also carrying a walkie-talkie, is keeping
text: watch on the roof of the brownstone. He signals "all clear"
text: to his counterpart watching from the house opposite.
scene_heading: INT. UNMARKED CAR - THAT MOMENT
text: TWO MORE PLAINCLOTHESMEN are parked at the end of the block,
text: munching on donuts and watching the same brownstone. They
text: spot a POSTMAN lugging his sack up the tree-lined street on
text: his way to the brownstone. One of the PLAINCLOTHESMEN picks
dialog: up his RADIO MIKE:
speaker_heading: PLAINCLOTHESMAN
text: Mailman's coming.
scene_heading: EXT. BROWNSTONE - A MINUTE LATER
text: The POSTMAN marches up the front steps of the brownstone,
text: sorting through letters and packages. He hasn't even rung the
text: bell when the door is opened by ANOTHER COP -- who snatches
text: the mail delivery from his hands and SLAMS THE DOOR IN HIS
speaker_heading: FACE.
scene_heading: INT. BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT
text: MORE COPS, at least half a dozen, are milling about inside --
text: unshaven, ties loosened, shirtsleeves rolled up. They're in
dialog: for the long haul.
text: The first COP gives a handful of letters to a couple of
text: COLLEAGUES -- then hands over a PARCEL, wrapped in brown
text: paper, to a pair of BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERTS. They carry it
text: gingerly into the kitchen. Into the midst of all this
text: bustling activity strides COMMISSIONER GORDON:
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Anything suspicious!
text: In the parlor, where all the shades are drawn, TWO COPS are
text: examining each letter in turn, holding them up to a light
text: bulb, CREASING THEM carefully before slitting them open.
speaker_heading: COP
text: Nothing yet. Christmas cards and bills.
text: He anxiously watches their progress. A VOICE calls from the
dialog: kitchen.
speaker_heading: BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERT (V.O.)
dialog: Commissioner -- ?
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER
text: GORDON enters. The bomb-disposal boys have their equipment
text: scattered all over the kitchen table. They've slit the brown-
text: paper wrapping of the PACKAGE, exposing a ROUND DECORATIVE
dialog: TIN.
scene_heading: BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERT
dialog: It's a fruitcake.
text: He lifts the lid for GORDON to have a look.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: ...Have it analyzed.
scene_heading: INT. BROWNSTONE - ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT
text: A bleary-eyed ELLIOTT TIPTREE marches down the stairs carrying
text: a pair of OVERSIZED SUITCASES. His WIFE and TWO KIDS are
text: behind him -- all bundled up, preparing to embark on an
dialog: extended vacation.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: Mrs. Tiptree? The car's here.
text: TIPTREE, fighting back tears, embraces his wife for a long
text: wordless moment. Their LITTLE GIRL, aged six, tugs at Mommy's
dialog: sleeve.
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
dialog: I don't wanna go to Grandma's. I wanna
dialog: stay here with Daddy.
speaker_heading: MRS. TIPTREE
dialog: She's got a nice tree just like ours,
dialog: honey. Daddy'll be up as soon as he can.
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
text: She's old. She doesn't even have cable.
speaker_heading: LITTLE BOY
dialog: What about our presents?
text: He gestures toward the GIFTS piled high around the tree in the
dialog: parlor.
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: Don't worry. I'll bring 'em up with me.
dialog: We'll open 'em when I get there.
text: TIPTREE forces a smile for the kids. He CLUTCHES his wife's
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Sorry, folks, but we'd better move along.
speaker_heading: MRS. TIPTREE
dialog: Kids? Tell your Daddy goodbye...
text: Tearful hugs all around; then a cadre of UNIFORMED COPS escort
text: MRS. TIPTREE and the KIDS to the door. TIPTREE pulls GORDON
dialog: aside.
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: They'll be safe, won't they?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: As safe as we can make 'em.
dialog: <i>(beat; sternly)</i>
dialog: It would help if you could give us some
dialog: small hint what this is all about.
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: I told you. I...
text: TIPTREE shrugs helplessly and stares at his shoes. GORDON is
text: convinced he's holding something back.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: You have no idea what was in that box that
text: Provost had delivered from the bank.
text: TIPTREE shakes his head wearily. GORDON glowers as he turns
dialog: to go.
speaker_heading: GORDON (cont.)
dialog: All right, Mr. Tiptree. Merry Christmas.
text: GORDON exits. TIPTREE wanders listlessly into the living
text: room, pulls back the drapes, and WATCHES as his wife and kids
text: ride off in a convoy of POLICE CARS. One of the COPS tries to
text: pull him away from the window, but he refuses to move...
text: ...until a PHONE RINGS. Everyone jumps at once. A TECHNICIAN
text: hits a switch on a loudspeaker-and-tape-recorder assembly,
text: then gestures for TIPTREE to pick up the receiver...
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: Hello...?
scene_heading: VOICE ON LOUDSPEAKER
dialog: Mr. Tiptree? Andy here. Listen -- we've
dialog: got a chance to grab a good-sized block of
dialog: Atlantic Teledyne at twenty-six and an
dialog: eighth --
text: The COPS heave sighs and turn off their tracing equipment.
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: Not today, Andy. Let's talk after New
dialog: Year's.
text: TIPTREE hangs up and starts to BAWL right there in the middle
text: of the room. The COPS turn away in sympathetic embarrassment
text: as he goes to a corner wet bar and pours himself a good stiff
dialog: jolt.
scene_heading: INT. TIPTREE'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: Wallowing in despair, TIPTREE sits at an antique secretary
text: composing a LETTER. He takes a long pull on a glass of
text: Scotch, signs his name, and inserts the letter into an
text: envelope. He opens the desk drawer -- takes a long look at a
text: .38 automatic stashed inside -- then finds a stamp and affixes
text: it to the envelope. He addresses it to BRUCE WAYNE.
text: A moment later he hears a noise at the window: TINK TINK TINK.
text: He peers through the blinds and sees a CARRIER PIGEON on the
text: ledge outside -- pecking at the glass, asking to come in.
text: He raises the window and the PIGEON hops fearlessly inside,
text: onto the sill. The bird, well-trained, struggles only
text: slightly as he unties a tiny CAPSULE from its leg and removes
text: a FOLDED NOTE. Scrawled across it is a handwritten message:
text: IF POLICE SEE THIS YOUR FAMILY IS DEAD
text: He opens the note and begins to read as the PIGEON takes wing.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - DAY
text: BRUCE is at his desk examining the morning editions. A BANNER
text: HEAD-LINE shrieks:
scene_heading: BATMAN SOUGHT IN PUBLISHER'S MURDER
dialog: Bat Attack Panics Gotham Square
dialog: J. Harrison Provost, 41, Leaves Distinguished Legacy
text: He hears a VISITOR arriving in the entry hall. He gets up...
scene_heading: INT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT - DAY
text: BRUCE ambles out and sees SELINA, who's just arrived, doing
text: her patetented thing on ALFRED.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: English accents are so stimulating.
dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: You have the most beautiful silver hair!
text: ALFRED stammers as she reaches up to STROKE HIS HAIR. He's
text: about to break into a sweat. He's eminently relieved when she
dialog: turns and sees --
speaker_heading: SELINA (cont.)
dialog: Bruce!
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Selina. What are you doing here?
text: ALFRED affects a look of grandmotherly outrage as SELINA
text: slinks over and takes BRUCE by the arm. She's on him like a
text: barnacle.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I wanted to see your things, remember?
dialog: And I got tired of waiting for you to call
dialog: me back.
dialog: <i>(gesturing toward ALFRED)</i>

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER - DAY
text: BRUCE leads SELINA down a hallway to the armory. He glances
text: back over his shoulder and sees ALFRED peering snoopily around
dialog: the corner.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: You heard about Harry Provost.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: It's incredibly awful. It got me a little
dialog: worried.
dialog: <i>(sidling up closer)</i>
dialog: I hate to think of something happening to
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Same here.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: It's odd, though. Danger, the thought of
text: suddenly dying -- in a weird way it gets
dialog: you sort of...aroused. Don't you think?
text: BRUCE cocks an eyebrow at her. Everything gets her sort of
dialog: aroused.
scene_heading: INT. ARMORY - A MOMENT LATER
text: SELINA BEAMS at the fantastic collection of armored gear and
text: exotic weapons. She's like a kid in a toy shop.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Bruce, this is incredible.
dialog: <i>(indicating a suit of armor)</i>
dialog: Malaysian -- ?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Not bad. Sarawak warrior caste.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: It's like -- everything in here is another
dialog: little piece of your mind. I was right
dialog: about you.
dialog: <i>(turning to face him)</i>
dialog: Promise, okay? Promise you'll show me
dialog: every inch of this place.
scene_heading: PAGE 87 MISSING FROM HARD COPY
scene_heading: INT. BATCAVE - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER
text: ALFRED is at a PRINTER, scanning page after page of computer
text: printout. He delivers his findings to BRUCE, who's seated at

speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: The police have no files whatsoever on

speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: <i>(abstractedly)</i>
dialog: London...Cairo...Belgium...
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: What exactly are you --
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Her credit card records.
dialog: <i>(looking up)</i>
dialog: Every major art theft in the last five
dialog: years -- she's been on the scene or close
dialog: to it.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: You mean she's some sort of -- collector?
dialog: A...cat burglar, or --
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Could be. Museum curator, authenticator
dialog: -- she's got the perfect cover for it.
dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: What would she want with that stupid
dialog: raven?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Raven, sir?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: That's what the Catwoman took from
text: Provost. A little raven statuette, about
dialog: so big...
dialog: <i>(shaking his head)</i>
dialog: But it couldn't have been that valuable.
text: He continues to scan the screen. ALFRED is suddenly lost in
dialog: thought.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: How very odd.
dialog: <i>(long pause)</i>
dialog: I'm sure it's nothing, but --
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What, Alfred?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Your father had a raven, sir. A small
dialog: statue of the very sort you describe. It
text: used to sit on his desk.
text: This piques BRUCE's interest. He swivels around in his chair
text: and stares directly up at ALFRED.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What happened to it?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: After your father's...demise, Mr. Tiptree
dialog: came to the house and asked if he could
dialog: have it. As a keepsake. I saw no harm...
dialog: <i>(shrugging)</i>
dialog: That was thirty years ago.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Wait a minute. Mr. Tiptree?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: George Tiptree. Your friend Elliott's
dialog: father.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. TIPTREE'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON
text: TIPTREE has an oversized suitcase open on the bed. It's empty
text: -- except for the BALLED-UP WADS of NEWSPAPER which he's
text: stuffing inside it. His head turns suddenly at the sound of
dialog: the doorbell...
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER
text: TIPTREE emerges from his bedroom and peers over a bannister
text: into the ENTRYWAY below. Standing there is an unexpected
text: visitor -- BRUCE WAYNE -- holding his arms aloft while a
text: battery of COPS pat him down.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What are you looking for -- Batarangs?
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: Bruce! Come on up.
dialog: <i>(to the COPS)</i>
dialog: I want to talk to Mr. Wayne alone.
text: The COPS look on suspiciously as BRUCE ascends the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. TIPTREE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER
text: TIPTREE lets BRUCE inside and shuts the door behind him.
text: BRUCE hands him a GIFT BOX.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I brought you a Christmas present. Sorry
dialog: about the wrapping -- the police made me
dialog: open it.
text: TIPTREE opens the box and pulls out a diamond-studded TIE
text: CLASP. He looks up at BRUCE with an odd mixture of
text: bewilderment and gratitude. BRUCE nods for him to try it on,
dialog: and he obliges...
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: ...I'm afraid I don't have anything for
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I think you may have something that
dialog: belonged to my father.
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: -- You know?
text: He stares at BRUCE, astonished. His head sinks into his
dialog: hands.
speaker_heading: TIPTREE (cont.)
dialog: It'll all be over tomorrow. One way or
dialog: another, it'll all be over.
dialog: <i>(looking up; despondent)</i>
dialog: I've decided, Bruce. I'm gonna give him
text: the last two ravens. He's already got the
dialog: others.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What are you talking about? Who?
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: Batman. I don't know how he found out,
dialog: but --
text: TIPTREE reaches for the bottle on his desk to pour himself a
text: drink, but BRUCE angrily knocks the glass out of his hands.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: It's time you told me what's going on
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: Didn't you ever wonder where it came from,
dialog: Bruce? All the privilege, all the power
dialog: ...all the money?
dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: The ravens are a...a kind of map, Bruce.
dialog: The key to an incredibly vast fortune.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Whose fortune?
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: Gotham City's.
scene_heading: FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS)
text: The cobblestone streets of 19th-Century Gotham. A massive

speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: In 1880 the Gotham City Treasury was
dialog: looted. It was a fantastic operation --

speaker_heading: TIPTREE

scene_heading: BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND TIPTREE
speaker_heading: TIPTREE

speaker_heading: BRUCE

speaker_heading: TIPTREE

text: BRUCE stares at him, stony-faced. There's one part of the

speaker_heading: BRUCE (cont.)
dialog: I don't believe you, Elliott. My father
dialog: was a decent man -- an honorable man. He
dialog: would never have taken part in a scheme
dialog: like this.
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: It wasn't his doing, Bruce. It was --
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: That doesn't matter. If he knew that his

dialog: against the city...
dialog: <i>(violently)</i>
dialog: Reputation or not, he would've tried to --
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: Christ, Bruce! Do you want me to spell it

speaker_heading: TIPTREE (cont.)

dialog: and GRIEF --
scene_heading: BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE
dialog: -- an expression which perfectly matches the one which the

scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - BRUCE'S BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT
text: BRUCE lies motionless on his bed. Scattered about him are
text: SCRAPBOOKS, FAMILY PHOTOS and yellowed NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS
text: which describe the murder of his parents. Disoriented, he
text: gazes about aimlessly at his familiar surroundings -- which no
dialog: longer seem quite so familiar...
text: He folds his arms formally across his chest and stares up at

scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - DUSK

speaker_heading: BRUCE (O.S.)
dialog: ...Thanks for the testimonial.
text: ALFRED turns and sees BRUCE standing in the doorway, staring

speaker_heading: BRUCE

scene_heading: INT. TIPTREE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT
text: It's late, and the house is dark as TIPTREE treeds silently

text: in the kitchen, where the COPS are playing poker and watching
dialog: TV.
scene_heading: INT. PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
text: CHRISTMAS TREE LIGHTS twinkle in the darkness. TIPTREE kneels

text: out an OBLONG GIFT BOX with a tag addressed "TO DADDY -- FROM
dialog: SANTA."
text: With a glance back at the kitchen, he soundlessly unwraps the
text: package -- and opens it to reveal a matched set of RAVEN
text: STATUETTES. He transfers them to the big suitcase -- then
text: slinks into the hallway...
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM ACROSS STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: The two STAKEOUT COPS are chuckling at a Charlie Brown

speaker_heading: STAKEOUT COP I
dialog: Shit -- that's Tiptree!!

text: the brownstone.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Mr. Tiptree! What the hell are you --
text: HEADLIGHTS FLASH ON as the SURVEILLANCE CAR revs its engine.
text: TIPTREE breaks into a RUN -- and the COPS from the brownstone
text: follow suit. At the end of the block he vanishes down a
scene_heading: SUBWAY ENTRANCE.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY STATION - THAT MOMENT
text: A VIOLINIST is panhandling outside the token booth as the COPS
text: come racing down the stairs. The COPS trip over his open
text: violin case, scattering small change across the conrete floor.
text: They flash their badges at the booth and VAULT OVER THE
speaker_heading: TURNSTILE --
text: -- just in time to see TIPTREE, with his SUITCASE, scuttling
text: down a stairway which leads to the train platform below.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - A MOMENT LATER
text: TIPTREE steps onto an EXPRESS TRAIN. The doors slide shut
text: behind him -- and the hapless COPS curse under their breath as
text: he rolls off.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: We've gotta get back to the radio.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY CAR - A MOMENT LATER - MOVING
text: TIPTREE takes an open seat and looks around apprehensively.
dialog: Being fabulously rich, be's probably ridden the subway twice
text: in his life -- and at this time of night, EVERY FACE in the
text: sparsely-populated car looks vaguely menacing. Derelicts,
dialog: prostitutes, teen-gang members -- ALL OF THEM eye this well-
text: heeled stranger with intense curiosity as he clutches his
text: suitcase and stares anxiously at the floor...
text: An ODD, GAUNT FIGURE enters at the end of the car. It's a
text: DEAFMUTE. He shambles down the aisle passing out little white
text: CARDS. One side is a guide to International Sign Language.
dialog: The other reads:
speaker_heading: DEAF AND DUMB
scene_heading: PLEASE HELP -- $1.00
text: TWO YOUNG TOUGHS take a card and tear it in half, chuckling,
text: shining the DEAFMUTE on. A HOOKER, the heart-of-gold type,
text: stuffs a buck in his tin cup. He reaches TIPTREE and extends
text: a card; TIPTREE ignores him, refusing to make eye contact --
text: -- but the DEAFMUTE shoves the card insistently into his face.
text: Now TIPTREE looks up. THIS CARD bears a personalized message:
scene_heading: GOTHAM CENTRAL STATION
scene_heading: B-TRAIN WEST TO RIVERVIEW
text: TIPTREE's eyes widen. The DEAFMUTE -- who is in fact FRICK --
text: glowers down and holds out his cup. TIPTREE digs in his
text: pocket; the smallest bill he's got is a twenty, but he hands
dialog: it over anyway.
text: Smiling at this act of generosity, FRICK moves on to the next
text: car. TIPTREE stares down tremulously at the card. He fidgets
text: with his TIE CLASP -- the one BRUCE gave him earlier...
scene_heading: INT. LIMO - MOVING - NIGHT
text: TIGHT on a hand-held ELECTRONIC TRACING DEVICE. A small BLIP
text: moves across a shifting GRID not unlike a radar screen.
text: BRUCE is in the back of the limo, eyeing the tracer intently.
text: ALFRED's up front, at the wheel.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
text: According to this, he's directly below us.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: The subway, sir?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Yeah. Take a right.
scene_heading: INT. GOTHAM CENTRAL STATION - THAT MOMENT
text: It's slightly more crowded here in the hub of Gotham. TIPTREE
text: emerges onto the platform and spies a squad of TRANSIT COPS
text: thirty or forty feet away -- speaking into WALKIE-TALKIES as
text: they scan the crowd.
text: Sticking close to the tracks, he turns swiftly toward the
text: nearest stairway -- blending in with the crowd, trying to hold
text: the SUITCASE out of view.
scene_heading: INT. LOWER PLATFORM - A MINUTE LATER
text: TIPTREE IS RUNNING for the B-train just as the doors begin to
text: close. He manages to thrust the suitcase inside -- but the
text: doors SLIDE SHUT on his hand, and he DROPS IT. He stands
text: there on the platform, his face turning BONE WHITE as the
text: train lurches forward...
text: False alarm. The train stops, and the doors hiss open again.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY CAR - MOVING - A MOMENT LATER
text: TIPTREE clambers aboard with a severe case of palpitations.
text: As the train pulls out, a couple of rough-looking but helpful
text: STREET TYPES show him to a seat and hand him his precious
text: suitcase. He sits there panting...
text: Moments later, a DEAFMUTE enters the car. TIPTREE does a
dialog: take: it's the exact same guy who was riding the other line!
text: Of course, he doesn't know about Frick's malignant twin --
text: FRACK...
speaker_heading: WIPE TO:
scene_heading: INT. LOCAL STOP - TEN MINUTES LATER - NIGHT
text: Having changed trains twice more since we left him, TIPTREE
text: debarks at a deserted local stop. The station is EMPTY except
dialog: for one other passenger, who's gotten off here as well -- a
text: WOMAN in a long fur coat.
text: TIPTREE WATCHES as she approaches on her way to the stairwell,
text: STILLETO HEELS clicking across the floor. There's something
text: familiar about her -- but she's wearing a big, broad-brimmed
text: hat, and she TILTS IT DOWN as she passes, obscuring her face.
dialog: It is, of course, SELINA...
text: TIPTREE stands there expectantly with his suitcase, awaiting
text: further instructions. They aren't long in coming. A BLACK
text: MYNAH BIRD swoops out of the tunnel, lands on the platform,
text: and STRUTS in front of him.
speaker_heading: MYNAH
text: FOLLOW ME. AWWWKK! FOLLOW ME.
text: The bird flutters its wings and takes off again -- INTO THE
text: TUNNEL. TIPTREE stares after it in disbelief. Then the bird
text: CAWS AGAIN -- its shrill voice echoing from the darkness of
dialog: the tunnel:
speaker_heading: MYNAH (O.S.)
dialog: FOLLOW ME. AWWWKK!
text: TIPTREE clambers over the edge of the platform, dropping
text: awkwardly to the tracks below. Suitcase in hand, he begins to
dialog: walk...
scene_heading: INT. LIMO - MOVING - NIGHT
text: ALFRED tearing up the streets as BRUCE consults his tracer.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
text: He's slowed down. Looks like he's under
dialog: the park.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: How do you propose to get down there, sir?
dialog: We can't have Batman strolling up to buy a
dialog: token.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I know another way in.
dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: Step on it. They're down there waiting
dialog: for him.
text: ALFRED turns the limo hard right -- into GOTHAM PARK -- past
text: the statue of GENERAL WAYNE atop his horse...
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT
text: A LOCAL TRAIN roars by, filling the screen. When it passes,
text: we see TIPTREE with his suitcase, walking along the express
text: tracks at the far wall of the tunnel -- more frightened with
text: each step. It's dark and eerie down here in the tunnels; the
text: only illumination comes from dim LANTERNS spaced at fifty-foot
dialog: intervals.
text: He sees the lights of an EXPRESS TRAIN behind him, and quickly
text: switches to the local tracks. The train rumbles past with a
text: deafening blare, and the car lights briefly illuminate his
text: surroundings. TIPTREE glances over at the inside wall of the
dialog: tunnel...
text: ...where he sees, huddled in an ALCOVE just off the tracks, a
text: small gathering of HOMELESS PEOPLE. They've set up camp down
text: here in the tunnels, away from the elements. Surrounded by
text: bags full of old clothes, DINING on canned food and cheap
text: wine, they stare curiously at the well-heeled stranger with
text: the suitcase who's invaded their domain.
text: TIPTREE eyes them fearfully and picks up his pace, hastening
text: down the tunnel. The HOMELESS make no move to follow -- with
text: one exception. A KID, thirteen or fourteen, in a ratty
text: topcoat, climbs down onto the tracks and watches inquisitively
text: as TIPTREE vanishes into the shadows.
text: His face is familiar. It's DICK -- the boy vigilante from the
dialog: park.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL - FARTHER DOWN TRACKS - A MOMENT LATER
text: In this stretch of the tunnel the LANTERNS don't seem to be
text: working -- and the MYNAH is completely invisible. When he
text: comes to a fork in the tracks, he has to wait for the sound of
text: the bird's shrill voice to guide him:
speaker_heading: MYNAH
text: AWWRRK! FOLLOW ME.
text: TIPTREE stumbles ahead blindly in the darkness. He trips on
text: the tracks and drops the suitcase. As he's getting to his
text: feet, a FLASHLIGHT shines DIRECTLY IN HIS FACE...
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: STOP THERE.
text: The MYNAH BIRD flutters through the beam of light and perches
text: on the shoulder of an UNSEEN FIGURE. TIPTREE COWERS and
text: SQUINTS, trying to make him out, but the figure who stands
text: before him is shielding his face with an open UMBRELLA.
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: I've cooperated. I've done everything you
dialog: said.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Open the case.
text: TIPTREE lifts the lid, revealirig TWO RAVENS in the suitcase.
text: A CACKLING LAUGH echoes in the darkness.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN (cont.)
dialog: ...Two ravens?
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
text: The other one is Bruce Wayne's.
dialog: <i>(trembling)</i>
dialog: He doesn't know anything about this.
dialog: You've got what you want. There's no need
dialog: to --
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Thank you, Mr. Tiptree. You may go.
text: TIPTREE stands. He backs away from the suitcase warily.
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: My family. You won't --
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: We'll certainly take your unexpected
dialog: generosity into consideration.
speaker_heading: TIPTREE
dialog: We -- ?!?
dialog: <i>(shielding his eyes)</i>
dialog: You're not Batman.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: No. I'm his brother-in-law -- Birdman.
dialog: Now move out.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL - HIGH ANGLE - THAT MOMENT
text: TIPTREE marches slowly down the tracks, TOWARD CAMERA,
text: silhouetted in the flashlight beam. The beam SHIFTS SLIGHTLY
text: as the Penguin moves toward the suitcase and sets the light
dialog: down --
text: -- and we catch sight of the CATWOMAN perched on a steel
text: cross-girder above the rails, her CHROME-STEEL TALONS GLINTING
text: as she waits for TIPTREE to pass underneath.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL - ON TIPTREE
text: looking increasingly twitchy as he approaches the cross-
text: girder. He slips a hand into the pocket of his topcoat,
scene_heading: WHIRLS SUDDENLY --
text: -- and brings up his .38 AUTOMATIC, firing THREE QUICK SHOTS
text: at the PENGUIN. The shots RICOCHET LOUDLY off the umbrella --
text: which happens to be a bulletproof job. The PENGUIN lifts his
text: brolly; FIRE SPITS out of the shaft --
text: -- and TIPTREE staggers backward. SHOT IN THE CHEST. He
text: spins into a steel upright and topples, face-forward, onto the
text: ELECTRIFIED THIRD RAIL -- FRYING HIMSELF in a shower of
dialog: sparks.
text: The smoke is still clearing when the CATWOMAN drops to the
text: tracks. The PENGUIN rushes to her side to check TIPTREE for
text: signs of life.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: That idiot. Another six feet --
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: So sorry to spoil your fun. -- He brought
dialog: two ravens. We've got a complete set!
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: What??
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Yeah! They're in the suitcase --
text: An AWFUL RUMBLING fills the tunnel. They see the lights of a
text: TRAIN approaching on the center track -- the same one they're
text: standing on, the one TIPTREE's body is slumped across. The
text: PENGUIN's first impulse is to run back toward the inner track,
text: where the ravens lie, but the CATWOMAN is trying to drag
text: TIPTREE out of the train's path...
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: GIVE ME A HAND!
text: They pull the corpse onto the outer express track just as the
text: train arrives. They stand against the outer wall, waiting for
dialog: the train to pass...
text: ...and when it does, they see DICK -- the boy vigilante --
text: standing on the inner track directly across from them.
text: HOLDING THE SUITCASE. The kid takes off like a shot. The
text: CATWOMAN and the PENGUIN exchange quick looks of utter
text: disbelief -- and BOLT AFTER DICK.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL - ON DICK
text: The bulky suitcase is slowing his progress. He looks back
text: over his shoulder; although the stubby-legged PENGUIN has
text: fallen well behind, the CATWOMAN is gaining fast.
scene_heading: PAGE 101 MISSING FROM HARD COPY
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL - ON DICK
text: watching in the light from the train as the two costumed
text: figures grapple in the distance. He races back toward the
dialog: scene of the melee...
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL - OUTTER EXPRESS TRACK - THAT MOMENT
text: ...where BATMAN and the CATWOMAN are trading punches, blow for
text: blow. He knocks her off her feet with a vicious right hook,
text: and she sprawls on the track, dazed and bleeding. She lifts a
dialog: hand: <i>no mas</i>...
text: He looks back toward the suitcase on the center track. Before
text: he can make a move toward it, he spots ANOTHER TRAIN
text: approaching on the outer tracks -- right on the heels of the
text: last one. He crouches to pull the CATWOMAN's limp frame out
dialog: of its path...
text: ...but as he does so, a HORN BLARES -- and a SECOND TRAIN
text: comes barrelling down the center track from the opposite
text: direction! Now he's got trains approaching on either side,
dialog: and there's no place to go --
text: The CATWOMAN is groggily getting to her feet. He LUNGES at
text: her -- THRUSTS HER BACKWARD, toward an ALCOVE in the outer
text: tunnel wall.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL - ON DICK - THAT MOMENT
text: The OUTER train is already speeding past, obscuring BATMAN and
text: the CATWOMAN from view. The CENTER train is bearing down
text: fast. A split-second before it arrives, DICK'S HAND snatches
text: the suitcase out of its path -- and he TUMBLES TO SAFETY on
text: the innermost LOCAL TRACK.
text: He stands and watches as the two trains pass in opposite
text: directions. He doesn't know if BATMAN is alive or dead...
scene_heading: INT. ALCOVE - THAT MOMENT
text: BATMAN and CATWOMAN are flattened in the tiny alcove --
text: there's not two inches of breathing space between them and the
text: passing TRAIN. She's come around now, and she's FLAILING and
text: CLAWING at him, trying to PUSH HIM OUT.
text: HER HAND closes around his UTILITY BELT. As they struggle,
text: she hits the trigger of a SMALL GAS CYLINDER...
text: It's BRUCE's hydraulic BATWING DEVICE -- the one that saved
text: him when he fell off the roof. But this time the results are
text: altogether different. He GASPS IN HORROR as the WINGS OF HIS
text: CAPE stiffen and inflate -- FORCING HIM AWAY FROM THE WALL OF
scene_heading: THE TUNNEL.
text: His OUTER WING strikes the TRAIN -- FLAPPING WILDLY against
text: the passing CARS -- SNAGGING FINALLY on the ralling of the
dialog: rearmost car --
text: -- and BATMAN is suddenly RIPPED OUT OF THE ALCOVE -- DRAGGED
text: OFF DOWN THE TRACKS by the passing train!
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL - INNERMOST TRACK - ON DICK
text: He's still there with the suitcase -- waiting apprehensively
text: to see what's become of BATMAN. Finally the center train
dialog: passes --
text: -- and he sees CATWOMAN standing ALONE IN THE ALCOVE --
text: smiling at him -- advancing menacingly. DICK TURNS TO RUN...
text: A GUNSHOT rings out -- and the last thing he sees as he slumps
text: to the tracks is a whiff of SMOKE pluming from the shaft of
text: the PENGUIN'S UMBRELLA.
text: The PENGUIN's panting -- soaked with sweat. The CATWOMAN
text: snatches up the suitcase and rushes over to join him. She
text: peers off into the tunnels after BATMAN, exhilarated...
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: God. Did you see him? Isn't he hot?
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Haven't you got anything else to think
dialog: about?
dialog: <i>(mopping sweat from his brow)</i>
dialog: I'm hot. That was exhausting.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: No pain, no gain! -- Suck it up. We're
dialog: not out of here yet.
text: She sprints off down the tracks. SQUAWKING, he waddles along
text: behind her, as fast as his fat little legs will carry him...
text: As they vanish into the darkness, the CAMERA TRACKS back --
text: past DICK, who lies unconscious on the tracks, bleeding
text: heavily from his shoulder wound -- DEEPER INTO THE MAZE OF
speaker_heading: TUNNELS --
text: -- arriving finally on the ragged black figure of BATMAN as he
text: staggers forth from the shadows, dazed and bloody. He scans
text: the tunnel, finding no trace of his enemies -- and then his
text: gaze falls on DICK.
text: He limps over and KNEELS at the boy's side -- cradling his
text: head protectively, staring helplessly into the blackness all
dialog: around him...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. GOTHAM CITY SKYLINE - NIGHT
text: The stark outlines of the city, BATHED IN MOONLIGHT. CAMERA
text: ZEROES IN on the glowing, ornamental DOME of CITY HALL...
scene_heading: INT. CITY HALL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: A PENTAGONAL BALCONY girds the interior of the dome. We TILT
text: DOWN to ground level -- where TWO AGED SECURITY GUARDS lie
text: sprawled at odd angles on the marble floor, FATALLY SHOT.
text: The PENGUIN closes his gun-umbrella and waddles across the
text: atrium of City Hall, past a statue of blind Justice, to a
text: point directly under the dome. There, encased in a plexiglass
text: case, is a SCALE MODEL of GOTHAM CITY -- circa 1885, when City
text: Hall was erected. He shouts up:
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: LETS DO IT!
scene_heading: INT. CITY HALL - BALCONY UNDER DOME - THAT MOMENT
text: The CATWOMAN, FRICK, and FRACK are already up on the balcony.
text: Lining its periphery are various DISPLAY CASES of historical
text: interest; and positioned along the wall at each point of the
text: pentagon are FIVE ARCHED NICHES -- each one containing a
text: bronze bust. The patriarchs of Gotham's Five Families...
text: The CATWOMAN and co. go to work quickly. She removes the FIVE
text: RAVENS from a gunny sack as FRICK and FRACK work their way
text: around the balcony, YANKING the busts from their recessed
text: bases. She follows along behind them, replacing each bust
text: with a RAVEN.
text: When they're done, the PENGUIN yells up:
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Now. Give each raven a quarter-turn.
text: His pals in the dome oblige -- TWISTING each raven in its
text: recessed socket, in quick succession...
scene_heading: INT. CITY HALL - ATRIUM - ON PENGUIN
text: The moment of maximum tension. He stands there frothing at
text: the mouth with anticipation. SECONDS TICK OFF, and nothing
dialog: happens.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: What happens now?
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: I don't know. That's all...!
text: He looks around expectantly as the others peer down at him
text: from above. He really doesn't know what's supposed to happen
text: next. Suspecting the worst, he throws his umbrella to the
text: floor and begins STAMPING ABOUT IN A RAGE, SPUTTERING,
text: flapping his arms like wings.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN (cont.)
dialog: We've been TRICKED! It's a HOAX! It's
dialog: a --
text: He SHUTS UP suddenly at the sound of a loud CHUNK. Somewhere
text: behind him, ANCIENT GEARS are beginning to grind. He spins
text: and stares at the SCALE MODEL of GOTHAM in its plexiglass
dialog: case...
text: The city model is TREMBLING slightly. As he watches, the DOME
text: of the miniature CITY HALL -- in the dead center of the model
text: city -- POPS OFF on a hinge. A METAL STRONGBOX rises into
dialog: view...
scene_heading: INT. DOME - ON BALCONY - THAT MOMENT
text: The CATWOMAN, FRICK and FRACK stare down at the little metal
text: box. The PENGUIN is already clambering atop the plexiglass
text: case of the model, SMASHING AT IT with his umbrella, trying to
dialog: get at the box.
speaker_heading: FRICK
dialog: That's the treasure?
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: No. It's a map...
text: She affixes a ROPE to the balcony railing and CLIMBS OVER.
scene_heading: INT. CITY HALL - ATRIUM - ON PENGUIN
text: The plexiglass case finally SHATTERS -- and the PENGUIN falls
text: through, landing atop Gotham City. He snatches at the
text: strongbox and gets to his feet, bestriding the city like a
text: colossus. He's climbing down off the tabletop when the
text: CATWOMAN, on her rope, touches down behind him.
text: He hunkers down on the floor and knocks the rusted padlock off
text: the box. He opens it and stares greedily at the contents -- a
text: MAP and a bunch of old, crumbling PHOTOS. The CATWOMAN creeps
text: over to his side:
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Bruce Wayne. So he doesn't know a thing
dialog: about the treasure, eh...?
dialog: <i>(handing her the map)</i>
dialog: Look at this. It's right under Wayne
dialog: Manor. It's been there all along!
text: Now the CATWOMAN snatches at the PHOTOS. They show
text: progressively closer views of ANCIENT GNARLED STALACTITES --
text: an odd, distinctive SUBTERRANEAN ROCK FORMATION...
speaker_heading: PENGUIN (cont.)
text: Looks like some kind of cave.
scene_heading: FADE THROUGH TO:
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - GUEST BEDROOM - DAY
text: TIGHT ON THE FACE of DICK. He lies unconscious in a big soft
text: frilly bed A WOMAN'S HAND wipes his feverish brow with a damp
text: cloth; he moans slightly...
text: His eyes snap open suddenly. He sits BOLT UPRIGHT with a
dialog: yelp.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: No, no -- don't try to get up -- you're
dialog: hurt.
text: He pushes her aside and climbs out of bed anyway. His
text: shoulder is bandaged, his arm in a sling. The pajamas he's
text: wearing are three sizes too large. He paces about, staring at
text: his unfamiliar surroundings.
speaker_heading: VICKI (cont.)
dialog: It's all right. You're safe. You can
dialog: stay here as long as you need to.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: I don't belong here. You can't keep me
dialog: here.
text: Vaguely unnerved, he goes to a window, pulls back the shades,
text: looks out at the grounds.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: It's "Dick", isn't it? Or do you prefer
dialog: "Richard"?
text: He stares at her as if she's nuts. VICKI opens a closet door:
text: all of his ratty belongings are hanging inside -- including
text: the red-and-green GYMNAST'S SUIT with the "R" insigne on the
dialog: breast.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: "R" -- for Richard, right? See, all your
dialog: things are here...
dialog: <i>(staring at the costume)</i>
dialog: What is it, some kind of gymnast's outfit?
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: It's none of your business. What is this,
dialog: some kind of home?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: No, not that kind. There's a swimming
dialog: pool -- tennis court -- you can have
dialog: anything you want.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Tennis court?! -- Lady, you're rich. How
dialog: the hell would you know what I want?
text: VICKI tries to lay a soothing arm on his shoulder. He bats it
text: away, pushes her aside and turns toward the door in
dialog: agitation --
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: I'm not staying. You can't make me --
text: -- and sees BRUCE standing in the doorway looking at him.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I can make you.
text: DICK freezes -- as if BRUCE's mere presence has mesmerized
text: him. The hint of a smile plays across his face: ohhhhh. I'm
text: in Batman's house.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (cont.)
dialog: Come on. Wanna go at it?
dialog: <i>(no response)</i>
dialog: Look, kid -- like it or not, you're my
dialog: guest -- and long as you're here you might
dialog: as well enjoy it.
text: ALFRED appears with a tray of hot food and sets it down on a
text: bedside table. DICK edges toward it and sits down. He waits
text: for ALFRED to leave and then TUCKS IN HUNGRILY -- eyeing BRUCE
dialog: all the while.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (cont.)
dialog: Will you two be okay in here?
text: VICKI nods yes. BRUCE backs out of the room.
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - OUTSIDE GUEST ROOM - DAY
text: BRUCE pulls the door shut. ALFRED follows him down the hall.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: What do you propose to do with him, sir?
dialog: Keep him in the room for the rest of his
dialog: life?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I don't know, Alfred. I've got other
dialog: stuff to worry about.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: The child is hurt, sir. At the very least
dialog: we should attempt to locate his parents.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: He hasn't got any parents.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: How do you know that, sir?
text: BRUCE turns and fixes ALFRED with a steely gaze.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: ...I know.
text: The PHONE RINGS as BRUCE starts down the long stairway.
text: ALFRED picks up a hallway extension. He covers the
dialog: mouthpiece:
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Sir -- it's Miss Kyle.
text: BRUCE rushes back upstairs to take the call.
scene_heading: INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - THAT MOMENT - DAY
text: ARCTIC BIRDS chirping all around in the penguin-pool room. A
text: SNOW OWL struts across the PENGUIN's desk as SELINA makes a
text: phone call -- with the PENGUIN, FRICK, and FRACK hovering over
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Well! Tall, dark and handsome. Are we
dialog: still on for tonight?
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - ON BRUCE
text: He covers the receiver and stares intensely at ALFRED. On his
dialog: look we
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - FRONT PARLOR - NIGHT
text: Christmas carols playing. VICKI's got DICK helping her trim
dialog: the tree.
scene_heading: INT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: BRUCE is getting dressed for his date with SELINA.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Is this necessary, sir? After all...it is
dialog: Christmas eve.
text: BRUCE reaches for his UTILITY BELT. He empties the contents
text: of one packet onto a dresser: a dozen tiny, red GLASSINE
text: CAPSULES. He scoops up a handful of the CAPSULES and deposits
text: them in his jacket pocket.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Stuff'll knock out a moose, much less a
dialog: cat.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I don't like to see you going out on a
dialog: date...unprotected, sir.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: She'll be ready for Batman -- but not for
dialog: me.
dialog: <i>(turning to go)</i>
dialog: It's the only way, Alfred. I've got to
dialog: take her out tonight.
scene_heading: INT. ENTRY HALL - FIVE MINUTES LATER (DICK'S POV)
text: DICK watches from the front parlor as VICKI meets BRUCE at the
text: bottom of the stairs. The two of them exchange a few brief
text: words; he embraces her, strokes her hair gently -- then glumly
text: sets his jaw and moves off toward the front door.
text: VICKI reenters the parlor, trying to force an expression of
text: cheer as DICK turns discreetly away. This is one weird
dialog: household he's landed in...
scene_heading: INT. SELINA'S LOFT - NIGHT
text: SOFT MUSIC plays in the background as SELINA preens in front
text: of a vanity, doing her eye makeup, taking great pleasure in
text: her own reflection. She's looking especially sultry tonight
text: in a glittering low-cut gown. She lowers one shoulder strap
text: and strikes a pose in the mirror: better. She runs a hand
text: through her hair, TOUSLING IT for that recently-ravished look.
text: The DOORBELL rings, and by the time SELINA crosses over to
text: answer it, she's lowered the other strap as well -- which
text: means she has to hold up the top of her dress with one hand.
text: BRUCE finds himsell dumbstruck as she lets him in. She pulls
text: up both straps as she greets him nonchalantly:
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: You're early. I'm afraid I'm not quite
dialog: dressed.
text: BRUCE enters and takes a long look around. It's a big open
text: loft, only partly finished, filled with Egyptian artifacts.
text: The walls feature modern paintings with CAT MOTIFS. The
text: finished section is dominated by a huge BED on a raised
text: platform -- three or four CATS are walking around on it,
text: yowling at BRUCE. SELINA CHUCKLES as he scopes it all out.
speaker_heading: SELINA (cont.)
dialog: If you're looking for my bondage gear,
text: it's at the cleaners.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Christmas eve. No tree?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: No presents. I've been a bad girl this
dialog: year.
text: BRUCE takes a seat on the sofa while SELINA goes to a nearby
dialog: wet bar.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I'm surprised you kept this date. I
dialog: thought you would've lost interest by now.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: What makes you say that?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: You've got what you want, don't you?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I do now.
dialog: <i>(smiling)</i>
dialog: We've had this date for a long, long time.
text: With that, she sets the drinks down on the table and moves in
text: to KISS him -- a long, slow, wet kiss. But BRUCE seems
text: strangely unresponsive. She breaks free and gives him a funny
dialog: look.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: How much is it going to cost me?
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: ...To get the ravens back.
text: He watches her closely for a reaction. SELINA's shocked, but
text: she conceals it well -- chuckling in apparent confusion.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: You're the oddest man I've ever met.
dialog: <i>(moving in on him)</i>
dialog: Let's talk later, Bruce. I've got kind of
text: a short fuse...
text: BRUCE tenses slightly as she KISSES him again -- leaving a
text: crimson LIPSTICK SMEAR on his cheek. She works her way
text: downward, kissing him around his neck and throat...
text: HIS HAND reaches into his jacket pocket. He withdraws a tiny
text: GLASSINE CAPSULE. But before he can use it --
text: He JERKS BACK suddenly -- pushes her away. His free hand goes
text: to his neck, where a thin trickle of BLOOD is oozing from
text: between two bright red LIPSTICK LIPS. She's bitten him...
text: Now she SHUSHES him -- reaches over to the tiny wound and
text: massages it gently with one hand.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Did I hurt you? Just relax -- you'll
dialog: start to enjoy it.
text: BRUCE pulls away again. His eyes are strangely glazed. He
text: tries to speak, but his tongue feels thick and swollen.
speaker_heading: SELINA (cont.)
dialog: Bruce, you look faint. It must be the
dialog: cats.
text: BRUCE stands suddenly. It's as if he's mired in a slo-mo
text: nightmare. His legs give way beneath him and he topples to
text: the floor, INERT. His fingers go slack and the capsule rolls
text: out; he tries to reach into his pocket, but his arm won't seem
dialog: to work.
text: SELINA's cat, HECATE, strolls across his prostrate form --
text: purring and stretching...
speaker_heading: BRUCE'S POV
text: A worm's-eye view -- SELINA looms over him with a predatory
text: smile on her face, shifting in and out of focus.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What di-- what did you d--
text: She runs a finger across her lips and holds it up -- bright
dialog: red.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I guess I've...gotten under your skin.
scene_heading: BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE
text: His hand goes to the BITE on his neck -- and he realizes
text: SELINA's lipstick is spiked with a fast-acting PARALYTIC DRUG.
text: He writhes helplessly on the carpet, his whole body gradually
dialog: going slack.
text: The PENGUIN, FRICK and FRACK stroll through the doorway and
text: stand over him -- ALL LAUGHING...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT
text: A COUNTY SHERIFF'S CAR cruises past the manor, right on
dialog: schedule.
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - PARLOR - NIGHT
text: ALFRED on the telephone, checking in with the County Sheriff's
dialog: boys.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Everything's fine, thank you. We'll talk
dialog: in an hour.
text: Behind him, VICKI is waiting up for BRUCE. She's curled up on
text: the sofa, reading a book, throwing the occasional anxious
text: glance at a big grandfather clock -- which strikes eleven
dialog: o'clock.
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: DICK opens the bedroom door and peeks down the hall. He's got
text: all his belongings tied up in a bundle on the bed; he opens a
text: window and throws the bundle outside.
text: There's a nice strong TREE BRANCH some ten or twelve feet from
text: the window -- just close enough that he should be able to make
text: it. He climbs up onto the windowsill, crouches, and SPRINGS.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - OUTSIDE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: A car full of trouble: SELINA, wearing a fur coat over her
text: Catwoman garb, at the wheel; the PENGUIN riding shotgun; and
text: FRICK in the back seat -- next to BRUCE, who's semi-conscious
text: and stone limp. The car idles outside the wrought-iron gates
dialog: of Wayne Manor.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Try his mag card.
text: FRICK digs in BRUCE's pockets and finds a bunch of RED
speaker_heading: CAPSULES.
speaker_heading: FRICK
dialog: Look at this. He's a pillhead.
text: Now FRICK finds a mag-striped card and INSERTS IT into an
text: electronic device at the edge of the drive. The gates
text: magically part. There's a large VAN just behind the car --
text: driven by FRACK, and carrying two random GOONS. Both vehicles
text: pull in before the gates slide shut.
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - A MOMENT LATER
text: VICKI hears a signal from the security panel in the kitchen
text: announcing what should be BRUCE's arrival. She heaves a huge
text: sigh of relief -- then rushes to the door and flings it open.
text: She sees BRUCE standing there and her face lights up.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Ohh. Am I glad to --
text: To her horror, BRUCE topples forward -- and lands on the
text: floor, flat as a board. VICKI SHRIEKS as the PENGUIN enters,
text: throwing his arms wide.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
scene_heading: MER-R-R-RY CHRISTMAS!!
scene_heading: EXT. WAYNE MANOR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: DICK has shimmied down to a lower branch. He lets go and
text: drops to the snow, WINCING; his shoulder wound is bleeding
text: again. As he grabs his bundle, he hears RAUCOUS LAUGHTER
text: coming from around the house.
text: He races over to peer around the corner. He sees the two cars
text: out front. He sees the last of the goon squad barging in
text: through the front door.
text: His face full of confusion and conflict, he moves to a window.
text: In the entry hall he sees BRUCE on the floor -- and VICKI
text: surrounded by gun-toting intruders. One of them grabs her and
text: twists her arm behind her back.
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY - THAT MOMENT
text: VICKI shrieking and struggling as she stares down at BRUCE.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: What did you do to him??
text: SELINA gives her a catty little smile.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: First-time jitters, I guess. Everything
dialog: was going great, and then...he just went
text: limp as a noodle.
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - ON STAIRWAY
text: Drawn by the commotion, ALFRED rushes down the stairs to the
text: entry hall, pulling a robe around him. He freezes in his
text: tracks when he sees FRICK dragging VICKI into the front
text: parlor, holding a gun to her head.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: You'd be the butler. Why don't you come
dialog: on down and attend to your guests?
text: ALFRED hesitates, until the PENGUIN pulls a gun on him. He
text: marches down the stairs slowly, pausing by BRUCE's prostrate
dialog: form.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Mr. Wayne. Is he -- ?
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: You know how it is. Some guys just can't
dialog: hold their egg nog.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER
text: The PENGUIN marches ALFRED in where the rest of the gang's
text: already assembled. FRICK throws VICKI down roughly on a sofa
text: just next to the Christmas tree while the GOONS drag BRUCE
dialog: inside.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: I should explain the occasion of our
dialog: visit. There's a treasure underneath this
dialog: house -- and I don't plan to leave until
dialog: you tell me how to find it. Now who's
dialog: going to talk -- Miss Vale?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I don't know what you're talking about.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: The cave. Under the house. How do I get
dialog: there?
text: The PENGUIN gestures. FRICK holds the gun to her head.
speaker_heading: VICKI (cont.)
dialog: I don't know! I swear, I would tell
dialog: you --
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: <i>(turning to ALFRED)</i>
dialog: Then maybe you'd like to tell me.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: You're no more than a common thief.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Wrong, you old idiot. I happen to be a
dialog: very uncommon thief.
dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: Are you going to tell me, or does Miss
dialog: Vale get an early present this year?
text: FRICK cocks the gun. VICKI stares aghast at ALFRED, who scans
text: the room, weighing his options. Trembling, he shuts his
dialog: eyes --
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I...don't...know...
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Then go ahead, Mr. Frick...decorate the
dialog: tree.
text: FRICK's finger tightens on the trigger. VICKI winces. ALFRED
text: starts to blurt something out. But a split-second before he
dialog: can speak --
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Wait!
dialog: <i>(crossing over to VICKI)</i>
dialog: We don't know how to get down there yet.
dialog: We may need her when Bruce wakes up.
text: The PENGUIN sighs and waves FRICK off. ALFRED and VICKI heave
text: simultaneous sighs of relief. He throws her a shamefaced look
text: -- but she gives him a tiny nod of acknowledgement: you made
dialog: the right play.
speaker_heading: SELINA (cont.)
dialog: Besides -- I want this one for myself. So
dialog: pretty...I'm going to give her a brand new
dialog: face for Christmas.
text: The PENGUIN throws a look at BRUCE, who's still out cold on
text: the floor. He turns to FRICK and FRACK.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Why don't you two tie up our host?
text: ALFRED sits beside VICKI while SELINA wanders off to tour the
text: premises. FRICK and FRACK, meanwhile, drag BRUCE into a back
text: parlor which opens off the room they're in.
scene_heading: INT. BACK PARLOR - THAT MOMENT
text: They dump BRUCE face down on a sofa -- then rip the telephone
text: cords from around the baseboard and use them to bind his hands
dialog: and feet.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT PARLOR - ON MR. BONIFACE
text: Still holding his gun on VICKI and ALFRED, he wanders about
text: the room, admiring the various furnishings and expensive
dialog: objects.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: It's all so plush and tasteful, isn't it?
dialog: Just the sort of setting in which I've
dialog: always imagined myself.
text: ALFRED, on the sofa, can't resist letting out a snort of
dialog: disgust.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN (cont.)
dialog: I see. You think I'm vulgar. You think
dialog: I'm...<i>nouveau</i>.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I think you're a dirty little man with
dialog: a --
text: The PENGUIN silences him by sweeping one arm across a
text: tabletop, sending a bunch of PRICELESS CHINA FIGURINES
text: crashing to the floor. He points to ALFRED as FRICK and FRACK
text: reappear.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: See, boys, that's old money talking.
text: After a while, they actually start to
dialog: believe they've earned all this.
dialog: <i>(smirking)</i>
dialog: I don't mind. Someday I'll be old money
dialog: too -- when the statute of limitations
text: runs out.
speaker_heading: SELINA (O.S.)
dialog: Hey! -- Guess what I just found.
text: Face full of anticipation, he TURNS -- just in time to see
text: SELINA returning from the kitchen with a big silver tray of...
speaker_heading: SELINA (cont.)
dialog: Christmas cookies!
text: The PENGUIN is crestfallen, but that doesn't stop him from
text: cramming a handful of cookies down his gullet. SELINA
text: graciously serves VICKI and ALFRED, who munch away with
dialog: limited enthusiasm.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Let's spread out and see what we can find.
scene_heading: <i>(to FRICK and FRACK)</i>
dialog: You two -- keep an eye on our friends
dialog: here. Give me a yell the minute Wayne
dialog: comes to.
text: FRICK and FRACK post themselves at the doors to the front
text: parlor as SELINA, the PENGUIN and the GOONS fan out through
text: the house. CAMERA TRACKS WITH THEM as they move past BRUCE --
text: -- and in a quick CLOSEUP we see his EYES OPEN -- his hands
text: STRUGGLING against his bonds.
speaker_heading: SERIES OF SHOTS
text: QUICK GLIMPSES of the intruders enacting their depredations as
text: they search for the entrance to the cave. SELINA and the
text: PENGUIN are flinging open doors, moving clocks, looking for
text: secret panels; as they go, they systematically TEAR THE HOUSE
text: APART -- smashing BRUCE's possessions, ripping paintings out
dialog: of frames, etc.
text: Meanwhile, the TWO GOONS are outside prowling around the
text: grounds, looking for an exterior entrance -- and back in the
text: parlor, FRICK and FRACK are keeping their guns trained on
speaker_heading: ALFRED and VICKI.
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - CORRIDOR OFF KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: CAMERA TRACKS down a long, empty hallway -- arriving at a
text: LOCKED DOOR with curtained-off glass panels. Suddenly, an
text: ELBOW smashes through the glass -- a hand reaches inside and
dialog: fumbles for the lock --
scene_heading: INT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT
text: FRICK and FRACK start at the sound of a SECURITY ALARM blaring
text: from the kitchen. VICKI looks at ALFRED...
speaker_heading: FRICK
dialog: Better check it out.
text: FRICK stays behind as FRACK rushes out into the entryway and
text: down a long hall to the kitchen. He tosses a glance back at
text: VICKI and ALFRED, then steps out into the entryway himself.
speaker_heading: FRICK (cont.)
dialog: What is it? What's going on??
text: VICKI and ALFRED look into the back parlor. DICK GRAYSON has
text: sneaked in behind the sofa -- and he's busy sawing away at
text: BRUCE's bonds with a letter opener. Both of them stiffen
text: simultaneously -- if FRICK steps back inside, he'll have a
text: clear view of DICK and BRUCE.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT
text: FRACK has opened a panel on the kitchen wall, revealing the
text: SECURITY SYSTEM from which the alarm emanates. A RED LIGHT is
text: blinking, indicating DICK's break-in. FRACK throws switches
text: frantically, trying to kill the sound. Finally he succeeds --
speaker_heading: and SHOUTS:
speaker_heading: FRACK
dialog: Some kind of security system --
scene_heading: INT. BACK PARLOR - THAT MOMENT
text: DICK's gotten BRUCE free -- but BRUCE, still under the effects
text: of the drug, isn't much use. He tries to get off the sofa and
text: crumples in a heap.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Can you move, man?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Library -- got to get me to the library --
text: DICK slings an arm around BRUCE and drags him to a door
text: opening onto the hallway. They're just about to step outside
text: when FRACK comes marching back on his way from the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT PARLOR - ON VICKI AND ALFRED
text: -- faces wracked with utter, desperate tension as they watch
dialog: the situation develop.
scene_heading: INT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT
text: FRICK and FRACK conferring, ignoring VICKI and ALFRED for the
text: moment. By now the PENGUIN is waddling in from a hallway:
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: What is that ungodly racket?
speaker_heading: FRACK
text: A security alarm. It went off in the
dialog: kitchen.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: My God! Is someone in here?
text: He struts over to huddle with his cronies. BRUCE and DICK are
text: still poised in the doorway. It looks bad...
scene_heading: INT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT
text: ALFRED looks at BRUCE and DICK -- then at FRICK and FRACK
text: bickering with the PENGUIN in the entryway. He pats VICKI's
text: knee -- gestures for her to keep her seat --
text: -- and LUNGES at FRICK, making a play for his gun. A moment
text: of confusion ensues -- giving DICK and BRUCE just enough time
text: to dart out into the hallway, duck around a corner, and
dialog: vanish --
text: -- but ALFRED is a frail old gent, and he can't keep it up for
text: long; a blow to the face sends him sprawling to the floor.
text: FRICK instinctively pulls the trigger and SHOOTS HIM at point-
dialog: blank range.
text: VICKI rushes into the hallway -- screaming, crying.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT
text: The room's a mess, books all over the floor. The groggy BRUCE
text: props himself up against his desk. He manages to pull the
text: bottom drawer open -- gropes frantically for the secret
text: switch. He's CRYING.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Alfred...
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: I'll go back.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I can't...get down there...without you.
text: DICK turns. To his amazement, the sectional bookcase is
text: swinging open -- revealing the secret passage to the BATCAVE.
scene_heading: INT. ENTRY HALL/FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT
dialog: We will all be pleased to know that ALFRED has only suffered a
text: superficial wound to the arm. VICKI is on her knees beside
text: him; the PENGUIN is watching them with utter contempt.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: What an extraordinarily stupid thing to
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: SHUT UP. Help me with him.
text: The PENGUIN rolls his eyes and orders FRICK and FRACK to give
text: VICKI a hand without him. They carry him into the parlor, lay
text: him out on the sofa. VICKI reaches into her purse for a
text: handkerchief and begins binding his wound as the PENGUIN pulls
speaker_heading: FRACK aside.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: You and I had better check the ground
dialog: floor and see what's going on. Mr. Frick
dialog: -- do you think you'll be able to manage
dialog: this pair?
speaker_heading: FRICK
dialog: Yes sir.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Oh, good. That does relieve my mind --
text: He turns, glances into the back parlor, and sees a pile of CUT
text: CORDS on the love seat. The blood drains out of his face.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN (cont.)
dialog: Where's Wayne???
scene_heading: INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT
text: DICK has just entered another world -- and he's looking around
text: him in pure, unalloyed amazement. BRUCE is fumbling with a
text: packet on a spare UTILITY BELT; he shakes out a fistful of
text: pills and swallows them dry.
text: Then he goes to his bank of monitors and begins flipping
text: switches. They blink on one by one; DICK moves up behind
text: BRUCE and looks on, dazzled.
scene_heading: INSERT - MONITOR
text: The screen shows The PENGUIN in a sun room, shouting to his
text: two armed GOONS through a pair of French doors.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Check the grounds! The shape he's in, he
dialog: can't have gotten far.
scene_heading: BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE
text: He turns to his main control panel, reaches for a switch, and
dialog: waits.
scene_heading: EXT. WAYNE MANOR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
text: The two GOONS outside, with guns and flashlights, roaming
text: cautiously around the grounds. They turn suddenly --
text: -- as CORRUGATED-STEEL SECURITY PANELS slam into place over
dialog: every ground-floor door and window in Wayne Manor!
scene_heading: INT. SUN ROOM - THAT MOMENT
text: The PENGUIN sees the same thing happening, only from inside.
text: He listens helplessly as his GOONS pound on the steel panels
text: from outside. It's just occurred to him that he's trapped in
dialog: here...
scene_heading: INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER
text: DICK is up on a catwalk leading back to the library of Wayne
text: Manor. BRUCE shouts up to him from the control console down
dialog: below.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
text: -- as soon as he gets to the East wing.
dialog: Wait for my signal. You know what to do.
text: DICK nods yes and bolts off.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER
text: VICKI and ALFRED are still sitting at gunpoint. With the
text: commotion going on all around them, FRICK is getting itchy-
text: fingered.
text: Suddenly the STEREO begins blaring at top volwne -- "SANTA
text: BRING MY BABY BACK TO ME." FRICK turns and stares at it in
text: confusion -- goes over to fiddle with the controls --
text: -- and suddenly BRUCE'S VOICE is coming through the
text: loudspeakers.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (O.S.; filter)
dialog: VICKI! RUN! NOW!
text: She's off the sofa like a shot, DIVING for the entry hall.
text: FRICK turns and takes aim --
text: -- but before he can squeeze the trigger, DICK's come out of
text: nowhere to HIGH-KICK him in the face! The shot goes wild and
text: the two of them tumble into the Christmas tree, knocking it
dialog: over...
scene_heading: INT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT
text: VICKI hits the floor of the entry hall. HUGE OAKEN SLIDING
text: DOORS are already slamming shut behind her. The same thing is
text: happening all down the hall -- the East wing of the house is
dialog: sealing itself off!
scene_heading: INT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT
text: DICK CARTWHEELS across the carpet -- catching FRICK high on
text: the chest and RAMMING him backward, into the hearth. Before
text: FRICK can regain his balance, DICK's BEANED HIM across the
text: back of the skull with a fireplace poker.
text: He bends and picks up FRICK's gun -- which he tosses to
text: ALFRED, who's been watching all this with some fascination
text: from the sofa.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Here. You might need it.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Thank you, Master Dick. And...bravo.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT
text: VICKI has made it to the wall phone. She can't seem to get a
dialog: dial tone --
scene_heading: VOICE FROM BEHIND
dialog: Do you really think we're that stupid?
text: VICKI turns, and realizes to her horror that the VOICE is
speaker_heading: SELINA's.
speaker_heading: SELINA (cont.)
dialog: I tawt I taw a puddy tat...!!
text: With that she raises a hand -- and her CLAWS pop out. VICKI
text: turns, grabs a carving knife from a wooden block -- but before
text: she can do anything with it, a WHIP cracks and wraps around
text: her wrist, jerking the knife loose. SELINA tugs on the other
text: end, reeling her closer.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: You know, I've got a great recipe for
dialog: Sliced Bitch --
text: VICKI lunges forward suddenly, causing the whip to slacken and
text: throwing SELINA off-balance into the center island. While
text: they're tangled up, VICKI grabs a MEAT CLEAVER and tries to
text: bring it down on SELINA, but SELINA rolls effortlessly out of
text: the way and returns the favor, SWIPING at VICKI with her
text: claws. VICKI brings a Calphalon skillet up just in time to
text: block the blow: CLANG.
text: VICKI sweeps her arm across the countertop, showering SELINA
text: with knives and appliances. It buys her enough time to make
text: for the door -- but SELINA comes flying after her. Another
text: downswipe with the claws -- but VICKI shoves a BUTCHER'S BLOCK
text: into SELINA's path, and her TALONS wedge a half-inch deep in
dialog: the wood.
text: VICKI rushes out while she's trying to pry herself loose.
scene_heading: INT. DINING HALL - A MOMENT LATER
text: SELINA enters but finds no trace of VICKI.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: I love a good old-fashioned catfight --
dialog: but this is pissing me off.
text: VICKI charges out from behind a sideboard, pushing a WHEELED
text: COCKTAIL CART before her. It SLAMS full-force into SELINA,
text: who lands on her back on the great long dining table. VICKI
text: is in the doorway to the entry hall by the time she gets up.
scene_heading: INT. ENTRY HALL - STAIRWAY - A MOMENT LATER
text: VICKI races up the stairs. She has a good lead, but SELINA
text: makes up the difference in a hurry. She takes the stairway in
text: three giant bounds -- reaches the landing just as VICKI ducks
text: down the hall and into a bedroom, slamming the door behind her
text: and LOCKING IT.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: HERE, kitty kitty kitty...HERE, kitty
dialog: kitty...
text: She KICKS THE DOOR OPEN.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT
text: SELINA enters and strikes a coy pose as she shuts the door
text: behind her. VICKI has opened a pair of French doors leading
text: to a balcony, but it's too long a drop. She stands there
text: paralyzed as SELINA advances.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: So this is where you earn your keep.
text: She GRABS VICKI -- holds her out at arm's length and shoves
text: her roughly back onto the bed. VICKI flails wildly as SELINA
text: kneels atop her...
text: SELINA's CLAWS shred VICKI's blouse, revealing a frilly
dialog: section of bra --
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Mmm! Frederick's of Gotham?
text: She plants a talon against VICKI's sternum and RAKES IT
text: DOWNWARD, drawing a RED STRIPE on the exposed flesh of VICKI's
text: belly. Now VICKI just loses it. She begins to SHRIEK
text: uncontrollably.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Not so loud, honey! The neighbors'll get
dialog: the wrong idea.
dialog: <i>(laughing)</i>
dialog: Santa's coming. Time for all good girls
dialog: to go to sleep...
text: She raises her claw-hand and prepares to slash down at VICKI's
text: neck. But an instant before she can strike -- VICKI goes
text: wide-eyed and shuts up. A BLACK SHADOW falls across the
text: moonlit bed. SELINA tenses --
text: -- as a BLACK-GLOVED HAND grabs a fistful of her hair --
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Miss me, "Angel"?
text: He yanks her bodily off the bed. Before she knows what's
text: happening, he delivers a POWERHOUSE UPPERCUT. She flies into
text: the door and knocks it cleanly off its hinges.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY/STAIRCASE - A MOMENT LATER
text: BATMAN steps out after SELINA, who's only now picking herself
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Okay -- let's do it, huh? You and me...
dialog: all the way this time.
text: She HISSES and jumps him. They grapple -- a quick flurry of
text: fists -- and he knocks her ass-over-teakettle down the long
dialog: stairway.
text: She gets to her feet, limping, and darts around a corner.
text: BATMAN marches implacably down the stairs, taking his time...
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER
text: VICKI rushes out of the bedroom. She looks down the hall and
text: sees FRACK flying out of the guest room, UPSIDE DOWN --
text: slamming into the wall opposite. He slumps to the carpet, out
dialog: cold.
text: A moment later DICK strolls out. VICKI rushes to his side --
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Come on. We'll be safe in the cave.
scene_heading: INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY/ARMORY - A MOMENT LATER
text: BATMAN PAUSES outside the door to the armory, which is
text: slightly ajar. He pushes it in cautiously...
text: ...and a HALBERD smashes through the wood frame -- slicing
text: down mere inches from his face. It's the PENGUIN wielding the
text: ax; he backs off in seeming terror as BATMAN advances on him.
dialog: But then --
text: -- SELINA springs down from a perch above the doors -- landing
text: on his back -- and the two of them are going at it again.
text: It's a room full of exotic weaponry, and most of it gets a
text: good workout in the next thirty seconds.
text: BATMAN dodges a LANCE -- which embeds itself into the wall
text: behind him, QUIVERING -- and swings a MACE squarely into
text: SELINA's ribs. It's a crippling blow; she flies backward,
text: knocking over a suit of exotic armor -- which TOPPLES,
text: knocking over another -- and another --
text: -- until the various suits of armor have all fallen over,
text: domino-style -- the last of them landing squarely atop the
text: cowering PENGUIN.
text: SELINA is badly hurt now. She makes it out of a rear door to
text: the armory. BATMAN pauses to check on the PENGUIN -- he seems
text: to be out for the count -- and sets off in pursuit of SELINA.
text: SEVERAL MOMENTS PASS before the groaning PENGUIN comes around
dialog: enough to dig himself out.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER
text: As the PENGUIN stumbles around a corner, he peers into the
text: LIBRARY. VICKI is crouched by BRUCE's desk, reaching into a
text: bottom drawer. A hidden panel in the bookcase pops open...
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT
text: As she helps ALFRED into the secret passageway, VICKI turns to
speaker_heading: DICK:
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Come on. Come with us.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: No. I can still help...
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER
text: The PENGUIN flattens against the wall as DICK sprints out of
text: the library and heads off in the opposite direction. There's
text: a flabbergasted look on his face -- he recognizes this kid.
speaker_heading: WIPE TO:
scene_heading: INT. BATCAVE - A MINUTE LATER
text: At the monitor bank, watching BATMAN's pursuit of SELINA, are
text: VICKI and ALFRED. They pivot suddenly at the sound of a
speaker_heading: VOICE:
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Such primitive entertainment.
text: He's holding a gun on the two of them. He stares about
text: delightedly, taking in the prehistoric splendor of the cave.
text: His eyes light up at the sight of the BATMOBILE, parked on its
dialog: little plateau.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN (cont.)
dialog: So Bruce equals Batman. It seems I've
dialog: discovered two treasures!
dialog: <i>(an evil smile)</i>
dialog: Don't move. I'd be only too happy to
dialog: shoot you both.
text: He pulls out his packet of photos and begins to scan the cave.
text: He spots the distinctive ROCK FORMATION in an upper vault of
text: the cavern. It's a couple of plateaus over; a long narrow
text: CATWALK runs past it, some ten or twelve feet below.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
text: The Gotham City Treasury. It's about to
dialog: be stolen twice.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Don't be absurd. You'll never be able to
dialog: get it out of here.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Oh, I'll manage somehow. You two are my
dialog: guarantee of that.
dialog: <i>(nudging VICKI with the gun)</i>
dialog: Let's have a look, shall we? You go
dialog: first.
text: He shoves her. She starts across the catwalk, his gun at her
dialog: head.
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT
text: SELINA's made it back upstairs, but she's moving at quarter-
text: speed, favoring one leg and clutching her ribs as she lopes
text: down the hallway. She's just passed the balcony overlooking
text: the entry hall when BATMAN appears dead ahead in her path.
text: He's ready to rumble -- but instead of responding, she packs
text: it in. She stops, slumps against a wall and begins to laugh.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: It could've been so nice -- you and me --
dialog: if only you weren't so screwed up.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: It's over. I don't want to hurt you any
dialog: more.
speaker_heading: SELINA
dialog: Tell me something -- one thing. If you
dialog: don't enjoy all this...why do you do it?
text: He just looks at her. He doesn't have an especially good
text: answer. She sighs.
speaker_heading: SELINA (cont.)
dialog: I'll never understand men.
text: She SPINS SUDDENLY, delivering a high-kick to BATMAN's throat.
text: As he reels backward, into a wall, she leaps up onto the
text: narrow BANNISTER RAILING some thirty feet above the entry hall
text: floor and goes into a CROUCH -- preparing to SPRING at the
text: enormous crystal CHANDELIER mounted to the ceiling --
text: -- but just as she launches off, BATMAN rolls -- and brings up
text: a GUN from his belt. He fires a RAZOR-SHARP DISK which sails
text: past her head, cleanly SLICING THROUGH the chain which
text: suspends the chandelier.
text: The chandelier FALLS just as CATWOMAN catches hold of it --
text: and she finds herself PLUMMETING to the floor of the entry
text: hall. On impact, the chandelier EXPLODES into a thousand
text: fragments; the CATWOMAN lands hard on her back and lies
text: sprawled in the midst of the wreckage, unmoving.
text: BATMAN advances slowly down the stairs. Her arms and legs jut
text: out at unnatural angles; she lets out an eerie, whimpering
text: YOWL OF PAIN -- a cri du chat. He stands over her; she glares
text: up at him.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Nine lives.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
text: I can't move. I can't move.
text: Her face is cut and bleeding. She tries to lift an arm and
text: can't quite manage it. He crouches down beside her, still
dialog: cautious...
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN (cont.)
dialog: DON'T LOOK AT ME!!
dialog: <i>(pleading)</i>
dialog: Do me, baby...do me now...that's what I
dialog: want. Please?
text: BATMAN looks up. DICK is standing on the balcony overlooking
text: them, highly curious as to what he'll do.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: No.
text: BATMAN slowly rises to his feet. She lets out another
text: gruesome WHINE.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: COME ON. Don't stop now. FINISH ME OFF.
dialog: <i>(almost weeping with pain)</i>
dialog: Son of a bitch. You're all alike...
text: Her STEEL CLAWS snick into place. With an agonizing effort
text: she lifts her forearm -- bends her wrist. She's trying to
text: slit her own throat.
text: He reaches for his belt, extracts a GLASSINE CAPSULE, and
text: breaks it open with his thumb. He drops it amid the shattered
text: glass around her face. A tiny cloud of GREEN GAS plumes out,
text: and her hand falls limply at her side as she lapses into
text: unconsciousness.
text: BATMAN stands over her for a minute as DICK marches down to
dialog: join him.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: You should've done it, man. You should've
dialog: killed her.
text: BATMAN gives him a long, hard look -- but says nothing.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: There's a radio in the cave. We'll send
dialog: for help.
scene_heading: INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER
text: The PENGUIN and VICKI are on a catwalk just below the ROCK
text: FORMATION. A STONE OUTCROPPING extends toward the catwalk,
text: and he forces her to JUMP FOR IT. Now he has to follow; the
text: prospect makes him nervous, but it's a short hop, and he
text: clears it okay -- finding his footing on the rocky slope.
text: They're cautiously making their way up toward the ROCK
text: FORMATION when BATMAN appears suddenly at the far end of the
text: catwalk -- sizes up the situation and FREEZES IN HIS TRACKS.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Ah, the illustrious Mr. Wayne. Look at
dialog: you now. Whatever would your friends say?
dialog: <i>(smiling)</i>
dialog: You've been an exceptionally congenial
dialog: host -- but I must ask you to back off.
text: The PENGUIN grabs hold of VICKI and HOLDS HER CLOSE as they
text: climb the last few feet toward the grotto. BATMAN swings his
text: cape around, concealing his hands from view. He takes a
text: cautious step backward.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - BATMAN'S HAND
text: His free hand closes around a BATARANG -- flicks it open.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON ROCKS - PENGUIN AND VICKI
text: They've pulled almost even with the rock formation. A LARGE
text: DANK GROTTO is visible through a small gap in the rocks.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
text: No sudden moves. It's a long way down.
text: Gun at her head, he peers into the grotto...
scene_heading: HIS POV - INSIDE THE GROTTO
text: A VAST FORTUNE in GOLD and SILVER BULLION, undisturbed in all
text: these years. GLINTING in the darkness. Hanging upside-down,
text: above it, like silent guardians, are BATS -- DOZENS of them --
text: their tiny wet red eyes GLIMMERING at the PENGUIN...
text: He dislodges a rock. It tumbles into the grotto...
text: ...and a startled BAT comes screeching out of the gap in the
text: rocks -- FLYING DIRECTLY AT HIS FACE.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON ROCKS - PENGUIN AND VICKI
text: He BACKS AWAY IN HORROR as the bat streaks past him. He FIRES
text: HIS GUN wildly. The SOUND OF IT rouses MORE BATS, and they
text: come flying out of the hole -- a VAST, CHITTERING SWARM.
text: VICKI SHRIEKS; the PENGUIN STUMBLES -- and the two of them
text: FALL BACK ONTO THE ROCKS, hanging on for dear life.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
speaker_heading: VICKI!
text: An instant later BATMAN lets fly with the BATARANG. Clean
text: hit; the PENGUIN staggers back, and his GUN skitters down
text: across the rocks.
text: With BATS screaming all around her, VICKI takes a deep breath
text: and VAULTS toward the CATWALK. She's a foot short; she grabs
text: hold of the railing and HANGS THERE, over the ABYSS, trying to
text: pull herself up. BATMAN races toward her --
text: -- but the PENGUIN, clambering down across the rocky
text: outcropping, has managed to grab hold of his GUN. The BATS
text: have begun to swirl up toward the higher recesses of the
text: cavern, and he's able to draw a clean bead on BATMAN.
text: THUNDEROUS ECHOES reverberate through the cave as the first
text: shot strikes BATMAN and knocks him backward. As the second
text: spins him around. As the third sends him TOPPLING OVER THE
text: RAILING.
text: VICKI screams. BATMAN manages to grab the rail with one hand.
text: Now two of them are hanging from the catwalk -- sitting ducks
text: -- and the PENGUIN is determined to empty the clip.
text: The ECHOES are cacophanous. ANCIENT STALACTITES drop from the
text: vaulted roof of the cavern, PLUMMETING DOWNWARD like deadly
text: projectiles, shattering agaist the cave floor. And then --
text: BATMAN pulls a tiny DEVICE from his utility belt and FLINGS
text: IT. It lands in the rocks at the PENGUIN's feet. He stares
text: down at it, and two beats later --
text: -- it begins to emit an EERIE ELECTRONIC WHINE. Within
text: moments, EVERY BAT IN THE CAVE is in a FRENZY -- HOMING IN ON
text: THE SIGNAL. The PENGUIN looks up sees them coming. A CHOKED
text: WAIL emits from his throat as he drops the gun and stands
text: there, PARALYZED.
text: He's just been beaten at his own game. He lets out a last
text: awful HOWL as HUNDREDS OF BATS ENGULF HIM --
text: -- and he PLUNGES DOWN INTO THE PIT -- his hideous scream
text: dwindling to a faint echo, then vanishing altogether...
text: BATMAN manages to drag himself up onto the catwalk. He rushes
text: over to VICKI, pulls her up, drapes his cape around her
text: protectively. Gradually, as the BATS recede to their distant
text: perches, he stands and helps VICKI to her feet. They embrace
text: on the edge of the abyss.
text: On the far plateau, DICK has hooked up with ALFRED. The
text: butler is slumped against a lab table, weary and exhausted,
text: clutching his wounded arm. DICK slings an arm around him and
text: helps him to the stairway.

scene_heading: EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT
text: SQUAD CARS everywhere. FRICK and FRACK emerge in handcuffs,
text: flanked by COPS. PARAMEDICS carry the still-unconscious
text: SELINA past on a stretcher and load her into the back of an
dialog: ambulance.
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY HALL - NIGHT
text: The place is an utter mess. Amid the carnage we find BRUCE
text: conferring with COMMISSIONER GORDON and LT. BULLOCK. In b.g.,
text: a POLICE DOCTOR is dressing ALFRED's gunshot wound.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: ...and then Batman showed up?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: He saved all our lives, Jim. I can't say
dialog: for sure, but I'd bet she's the one behind
dialog: the murders.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: God -- I pray you're right.
dialog: <i>(beat)</i>
dialog: One thing before we go, Bruce. Who's the
dialog: kid?
text: BRUCE looks into the front parlor, where VICKI and DICK are
text: righting the fallen Christmas tree.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Oh, that's Vicki's little cousin. He's in
dialog: town for the holidays.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Well, he picked a hell of a time to visit.
dialog: <i>(turning to go)</i>
dialog: Merry Christmas, Bruce. Good luck
dialog: cleaning this place up.
text: GORDON and BULLOCK file out, followed by the POLICE DOCTOR.
text: BRUCE smiles wearily to himself and strolls into the front
dialog: parlor.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT PARLOR - NIGHT
text: ALFRED loads 'SILENT NIGHT' on the CD. VICKI ambles up to
speaker_heading: BRUCE:
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: What are you going to do with all that
dialog: gold?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I dunno. Might be a good start on a place
dialog: to live -- for some people who don't have
dialog: one.
text: She hugs him. DICK plugs in the Christmas-tree lights; they
text: blink to life just as the GRANDFATHER CLOCK strikes twelve.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: It's Christmas.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Yeah. Maybe you should -- open your
dialog: present.
text: She runs a hand along his cheek and laughs softly.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Oh, Bruce, presents doesn't matter. None
dialog: of it matters. We're all safe. We're
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: ...You might as well.
text: He digs around in his jacket pocket and produces a tiny GIFT
text: BOX, which he hands to VICKI. She unwraps it, opens it slowly
text: -- and sees a DIAMOND RING inside.
text: She gazes up at him, speechless. He gazes back.
text: CAMERA PULLS UP and away until we can see the whole of the
text: devastated room, and all the people in it -- VICKI, falling
text: into BRUCE's arms; DICK, off to one side, watching them;
text: ALFRED, tossing broken furniture into a roaring fireplace.
dialog: And on the image of this decidedly eccentric family unit, we
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
